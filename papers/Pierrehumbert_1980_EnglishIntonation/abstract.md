# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This thesis develops a system of underlying representation for English intonation. It gives an account of what different tunes are possible and how they are aligned with different texts. It characterizes the rules which map the underlying representations into phonetic realizations.

The different tunes are described as structured strings of L and H tones generated by a finite-state grammar. The strings consist of one or more pitch accents, which are aligned with stressed syllables on the basis of the metrical pattern of the text, plus two additional tones which characterize the intonation of the end of the phrase. The pitch accents are either a tone, or a pair of tones on which a strength relation is defined. The two additional tones are the boundary tone, found at the end of the phrase regardless of the metrical structure of the text, and the phrase accent, which follows immediately after the pitch accent on the main phrase stress and controls the intonation from there to the boundary.

Local context-sensitive rules map the string of tones into the quantitative values which determine the fundamental frequency contour. These rules apply left to right, and include downstep and upstep rules resembling those which have been studied in African tone languages. A transform of the fundamental frequency domain which makes these rules linear is proposed on the basis of experimental data. Evidence is presented that superficial nonlocal intonational characteristics, such as the overall trend of the contour, really arise from local rules. The thesis also reviews other experimental results and explains how they are accommodated within the framework proposed.

## Our Interpretation

Pierrehumbert (1980) establishes a foundational phonological model of English intonation based on composable H (high) and L (low) pitch tones that can be combined into pitch accents and boundary tones using finite-state rules, with context-dependent phonetic implementation rules (downstep, upstep, declination) that map abstract tonal sequences to concrete F0 contours. The key contribution is demonstrating that natural-sounding English prosody can be generated from simple local left-to-right rules operating on binary tone symbols, eliminating the need for lookahead and making the system computationally tractable for speech synthesis. This work is critical for text-to-speech systems because it provides the theoretical foundation underlying ToBI annotation and enables rule-based generation of natural prosody through compositional combination of pitch accents and boundary tones that vary systematically with speaker baseline and previous tone values.
