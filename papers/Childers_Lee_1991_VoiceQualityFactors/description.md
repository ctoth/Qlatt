This paper analyzes the acoustic and physiological factors that characterize different voice qualities (modal, vocal fry, falsetto, breathy) using speech and electroglottograph signals, identifying four key glottal source parameters: open quotient (pulse width), speed quotient (pulse skewness), closure abruptness, and turbulent noise. The authors develop a new voice source model combining the LF glottal model with parametric turbulent noise, validate these parameters through perceptual listening tests, and demonstrate that glottal source characteristics can be systematically controlled to synthesize different voice qualities. This work is essential for speech synthesis because it provides the parametric framework and measurement techniques needed to generate natural-sounding speech with controllable voice quality, moving beyond simple pitch and amplitude variation to physiologically grounded control of source excitation.
