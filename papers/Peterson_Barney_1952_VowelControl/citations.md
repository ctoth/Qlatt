## Key Citations for Follow-up

- **Potter & Steinberg (1950)**: Foundational work on the sound spectrograph - the measurement instrument used throughout this paper. Essential for understanding the acoustic measurement methodology.

- **Stevens & Volkman (1940)**: Establishes the mel scale for frequency perception, which Peterson & Barney use for plotting their vowel loop diagrams - critical for understanding auditory frequency scaling.

- **Fletcher (1929)**: Classic reference on speech and hearing perception. Provides the power ratio framework used to normalize formant amplitude measurements across vowels.

- **Potter, Kopp & Green (1947)**: "Visible Speech" - provides the conceptual framework for acoustic phonetics and spectrographic analysis that underpins this entire study.

- **Koenig (1949)**: Practical guide to interpreting spectrograms and frequency calibration, directly relevant to the measurement procedures described in this paper.
