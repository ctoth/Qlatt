This paper provides a comprehensive retrospective on Voice Onset Time (VOT) measurement after 50 years of use, clarifying the original definition of VOT as the temporal relation between stop release and the onset of glottal pulsing, and extending the framework to intervocalic positions, fricatives, and affricates. The key findings show that VOT values fall into three main categories (prevoiced, short lag, long lag) with systematic variation by place of articulation, and the authors propose standardized Praat labeling conventions (VDCLO, VLCLO, REL, ASP) with automated tools for consistent measurement across studies. Understanding VOT timing and the ancillary acoustic cues that accompany voicing distinctions is critical for accurate stop consonant synthesis, particularly for capturing the aspiration duration and burst characteristics that differentiate voiced and voiceless stops in English and other languages.
