## Key Findings

### Stop Consonant Release Transients (pp. 120-124)
- Initial transient at stop release has spectrum amplitude about 13 dB (re 1 cm^3/s) in 300-Hz band for labial/alveolar stops
- Spectrum decreases by 1/f^3 above 2.5 kHz (taking 0.2 ms time constant)
- For velar stops (area change ~25 cm^2/s, 8 cm H2O pressure), source strength reduced by 12 dB
- Transient reversal limits spectrum amplitude below ~1000 Hz
- Click transient amplitude is about 11 dB greater than pulmonic stop release at high frequencies
- Click low-frequency spectrum is about 12 dB weaker than pulmonic stop

### Suction-Produced Sounds (pp. 121-124)
- Clicks use negative pressure behind constriction
- Volume V between constrictions: 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm = 1 cm^3
- 10% volume expansion causes ~100 cm H2O pressure decrease
- Release duration for clicks: ~20 ms
- Tongue tip trill natural frequency: ~30 Hz (from mechanical compliance)
- Trill produces transient bursts spaced ~30 ms apart

### Source-Filter Theory (pp. 127-129)
- Sound pressure at distance r: proportional to time derivative of volume velocity
- Output spectrum = Source spectrum x Transfer function x Radiation characteristic
- Radiation characteristic: +6 dB/octave up to ~4000 Hz
- Transfer function T(f) characterized by peaks (formants) corresponding to resonances

### Formant Frequencies and Bandwidths (pp. 131-136)
- Formants designated F1, F2, ..., Fn in increasing frequency order
- Complex pole: s_n = sigma_n + j2*pi*F_n
- Bandwidth B_n: points 3 dB down from peak at |sigma_n/pi| = F_n/12 (approximately)
- Peak amplitude at resonance: ~pi*f_n/sigma_n
- Above peak frequency: amplitude falls at 12 dB/octave

### Uniform Tube Model (pp. 138-140)
- Adult female vocal tract: ~14.1 cm
- Adult male vocal tract: ~16.9-17.7 cm
- For uniform tube closed at one end:
  - F_n = (2n-1)/4 * c/l
  - Female (14.1 cm): F1~630, F2~1880, F3~3140 Hz
  - Male (17.7 cm with correction): F1~500, F2~1500, F3~2500 Hz
- Radiation correction adds ~5% to effective length

### Helmholtz Resonator (pp. 141-142)
- Natural frequency: f_1 = 1/(2*pi*sqrt(M_A*C_A))
- Large volume acts as acoustic compliance C_A
- Narrow constriction acts as acoustic mass M_A = rho*l_2/A_2
- Approximates vowel /a/ configuration

### Coupled Resonator Behavior (pp. 142-147)
- Two-tube model for vowels: back cavity + front cavity
- When natural frequencies equal, coupling causes splitting
- Frequency shift: f'_o = f_o(1 +/- (2/pi)*sqrt(A_1/A_2))
- Stop consonant: constriction area from 0 to larger value
- Formant trajectories depend on constriction location and area

### Area Function Perturbation Effects (pp. 148-152)
- Formant shift from local area change:
  - Delta_W_n proportional to |p_n(x_1)|^2 - (rho*c/A)^2 * |U_n(x_1)|^2
  - Where p_n and U_n are pressure and velocity distributions
- At pressure maximum: area decrease -> formant frequency increase
- At velocity maximum: area decrease -> formant frequency decrease
- Lip rounding and larynx lowering: decrease ALL formant frequencies
- Lip spreading and larynx raising: increase ALL formant frequencies

### Losses and Bandwidths (pp. 152-159)
- Bandwidth contributions: B = power dissipated / (2*pi * total stored energy)
- Radiation bandwidth contribution: B_r = f^2*A_m/(l*c) * K_s(f)
  - K_s ~ 1.5 in frequency range 2000-6000 Hz
  - For tube 17.7 cm, area 3 cm^2: B_r ~ 2, 16, 50, 90 Hz for F1-F4
- Wall impedance: Z_sw = R_sw + jX_sw (both large compared to pc)
  - Typical: Z_sw ~ 1000 + j2*pi*f*2.0 dyne-s/cm^3
- Wall contribution to F1 bandwidth: B_w ~ 11 Hz (uniform tube 17.7 cm, diameter 2 cm)
- For bilabial stop closure (completely closed): F1_c ~ 180-190 Hz (measured)

## Rules/Algorithms

### Determining Effect of Area Perturbation on Formants
1. For a perturbation at position x along the vocal tract:
   - If x is at a pressure maximum (velocity zero): area decrease INCREASES formant frequency
   - If x is at a velocity maximum (pressure zero): area decrease DECREASES formant frequency
   - If x is between maximum and zero: no effect on that formant
2. Number of zero crossings for formant n is 2n-1 along the tube length
3. All curves pass through zero at the midpoint of a uniform tube

### Lip Rounding/Spreading Effects
- Lip rounding (decrease in area at open end):
  - Increases effective length
  - Decreases ALL formant frequencies
- Lip spreading (increase in area at open end):
  - Decreases effective length
  - Increases ALL formant frequencies

### Larynx Position Effects
- Larynx lowering:
  - Increases vocal tract length
  - Decreases ALL formant frequencies
- Larynx raising:
  - Decreases vocal tract length
  - Increases ALL formant frequencies

### Estimating Formant Frequencies from Coupled Tubes
1. Calculate individual tube resonances assuming no coupling
2. If resonances are close, coupling causes splitting
3. Use equation: f'_o = f_o(1 +/- (2/pi)*sqrt(A_1/A_2))
4. Greater area ratio = greater frequency separation

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Radiation Characteristic**: Implement as +6 dB/octave filter (first-order highpass) up to ~4 kHz. Equation 3.4 gives magnitude |R(f)| = f*rho/(2r).

2. **Transfer Function**: Model as cascade of second-order resonators (each formant). Each resonator has:
   - Center frequency F_n
   - Bandwidth B_n (determines damping)
   - Peak height proportional to F_n/B_n

3. **Bandwidth Calculation**: Total bandwidth has components:
   - Radiation losses (increases with f^2)
   - Wall losses (relatively constant, ~11 Hz for F1)
   - Subglottal coupling (if modeled)

   For F1: B1 ~ 50-80 Hz total
   For F2-F4: Radiation dominates at higher frequencies

4. **Stop Consonant Modeling**:
   - During closure: F1 drops to ~180-190 Hz (due to wall compliance)
   - Release transient: impulsive source, spectrum falls as 1/f^2 above ~2.5 kHz
   - Velar stops have weaker transient (~12 dB less) than labial/alveolar

5. **Formant Transitions**:
   - Constriction area changes cause formant frequency trajectories
   - Use perturbation theory to predict direction of formant movement:
     - Area decrease at pressure max -> F increases
     - Area decrease at velocity max -> F decreases

6. **Lip Rounding**: Decreases all formants (equivalent to lengthening tract)
   - Can model as ~5% effective length increase
   - Or as uniform downward shift in all formant frequencies

7. **Coupled Resonator Effects**:
   - When two formants approach same frequency, they repel
   - Frequency separation proportional to sqrt(A1/A2) for connected tubes
   - Important for modeling formant transitions in CV sequences

8. **Wall Impedance Effect on F1**:
   - For closed vocal tract (stop closure): F1_c ~ 180-190 Hz
   - Formula: F1 = sqrt((F1')^2 + F1_c^2)
   - This prevents F1 from going to zero during closures

### Formant Bandwidth Guidelines (from p. 155)
For tube length 17.7 cm, mouth area 3 cm^2:
- B_r(500 Hz) ~ 2 Hz
- B_r(1500 Hz) ~ 16 Hz
- B_r(2500 Hz) ~ 50 Hz
- B_r(3500 Hz) ~ 90 Hz

Add wall contribution (~11 Hz) primarily to F1.
Total bandwidth at each formant should increase with frequency.
