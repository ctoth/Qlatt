This paper investigates whether fricative noise amplitude or spectral properties are the primary perceptual cues for distinguishing voiceless fricatives like [f], [θ], [s], and [ʃ]. The authors found that spectral properties of the fricative noise and formant transitions are the dominant cues for place of articulation, while amplitude manipulations have minimal perceptual effect when spectral cues are congruent. For speech synthesis, this means getting fricative spectral shapes right is more important than precise amplitude control, and the sibilants [s] and [ʃ] are particularly robust to amplitude variation.
