This paper presents the CALM (Causal-Anticausal Linear Model), which unifies time-domain and spectral approaches to glottal flow modeling by treating the voice source as a mixed causal-anticausal linear filter with anticausal poles controlling the glottal formant and causal poles controlling spectral tilt. The key contribution is demonstrating that the LF model's open phase is a truncated anticausal impulse response, providing complete digital filter equations for implementing CALM with five universal parameters: open quotient, asymmetry coefficient, maximum excitation, fundamental period, and spectral tilt. This work is critical for speech synthesis because it explains how glottal waveform skewness and voice quality variations (tense/lax, loud/weak) emerge from linear filter properties rather than nonlinear polynomials, enabling more principled voice control in synthesizers like Klatt.
