## Key Citations for Follow-up

1. **Yarowsky 1997** - Foundational work on homograph disambiguation in speech synthesis using log-likelihood ratio; directly precedes this work and provides English homograph methodology that influenced TTBL design.

2. **Brill 1995** - Original transformation-based error-driven learning paper; essential for understanding TBL framework that TTBL extends with automatic template generation.

3. **Zhang & Chu (ref 3, ISCSLP2002)** - Chinese grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using stochastic complexity; provides competing approach to polyphone disambiguation specific to Mandarin.

4. **Wang et al. 1996 (ref 2, ICSLP96)** - Earlier broad homograph disambiguation study for Mandarin speech synthesis; establishes baseline approaches that TTBL improves upon.

5. **Yang & Pedersen 1998 (ref 8, ICML97)** - Feature selection methods in text categorization; provides theoretical foundation for keyword selection measures (information gain, mutual information) that TTBL evaluates.
