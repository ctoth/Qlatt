## Key Concepts

### Pole Extraction from Numerical Data (pp. 40-42)
- Method for extracting poles from transfer function calculations
- Loss-free case: find frequencies where N_a(omega) = 0
- Correction term for high Q formants is negligible
- Iterative procedure converges to better than 1% accuracy in 2-5 cycles

### Vocal Tract Transfer Function (pp. 42-43)
- Complete transfer function for non-nasalized sounds relates volume velocity through lips to pressure in soundfield
- Function includes: radiation characteristics, voice source characteristics, and formant poles
- Subglottal/nasal coupling adds additional zeros to system function

### Idealized Spectral Description (pp. 48-49)
- F1 and F2 are main determinants of vowel quality
- F3 and F4 contribute significantly to front vowels; less important for back vowels
- F3, F4, and F0 provide personal voice characteristics
- Number of variables can be reduced from 20-40 harmonics to four formants plus source characteristics

### Formant-Spectrum Relationships (pp. 52-58)
- Formant contribution can be derived from complex frequency plane representation
- Each formant enters as pair of conjugate poles
- Spectrum shape predictable from formant frequencies
- Intensity variations at any frequency governed by formant position changes

### Pole-Zero Decomposition (pp. 60-62)
- Nasal coupling and finite cavity coupling introduce poles AND zeros
- Poles and zeros must alternate along frequency scale in shunting cavity systems
- Average formant spacing approximately c/2l (where l = vocal tract length ~17.5 cm)
- Average spacing between oral formants approximately 1000 c/s

### Twin-Tube Resonator Model (pp. 63-67)
- Models vocal tract as two connected tubes of different areas
- Lip-rounding effect: lowering of all resonance frequencies below quarter-wavelength resonance of lip section
- Compensatory articulation possible: narrowing front = widening back (same length)

### Horn Resonator Theory (pp. 67-71)
- Catenoidal horn model provides more natural vocal tract approximation
- F1 primarily affected by area variation; higher formants relatively stable
- Horn increasing toward mouth: high F1
- Horn decreasing toward mouth: low F1

### Three-Parameter Vocal Tract Model (pp. 72-80)
- Parameters: (1) place of articulation, (2) tongue constriction area, (3) lip-rounding (l/A ratio)
- Model based on four homogeneous tubes: lip section, front cavity, tongue section, back cavity
- Standard dimensions: total length 15-17.6 cm, main cavity cross-section 8 cm^2

## Equations Found

### Pole Extraction (p. 41)

$$s_n = j\omega_{n_1} - N(\omega_{n_1})/N'(\omega_{n_1})$$
(Eq. 1.22-19)

$$N'(\omega_{n_1}) = \left[\frac{dN(s)}{ds}\right]_{s=j\omega_{n_1}} = \frac{1}{j}\left[\frac{dN_b(\omega)}{d\omega} + j\frac{-N_a(\omega)}{d\omega}\right]_{\omega=\omega_{n_1}}$$
(Eq. 1.22-20)

$$s_n = \sigma_n + j(\omega_{n_1} + \Delta\omega_n)$$

$$\sigma_n = \frac{N_a N_b'}{N_a'^2 + N_b'^2}$$

(Eq. 1.23-5)

Where:

$$R_0 = \frac{\rho\omega^2}{4\pi c} K_S(\omega)$$
(Eq. 1.23-11)

Pressure to volume velocity ratio:
$$\frac{P_1}{U_0} = \frac{\rho\omega}{4\pi l} \sqrt{K_S(\omega)}$$
(Eq. 1.23-12)

With directivity correction:
$$P_1/U_0 = \frac{\rho\omega}{4\pi l} K_T(\omega)$$
(Eq. 1.23-13)

Where K_T(omega) is total correction factor (max 7 dB at high frequencies, reaches 5 dB at 2000 c/s)

### Voice Source Poles (p. 45)

$$U_q = \frac{U_{q0}}{\prod_{r=1}^{4}(1-s/s_r)}$$

### Spectrum Envelope Function (p. 49)

$$|P(f)| = |U(f)| \cdot |H(f)| \cdot |R(f)|$$
(Eq. 1.3-1)

Simplified at 100 c/s cutoff:
$$|U(f)| |R(f)| = P_k \frac{(f/100)}{1+(f/100)^2}$$
(Eq. 1.3-2)

### Transfer Function Decomposition (p. 49)

$$|H(f)| = k_{r4}(f) |H_1(f)| |H_2(f)| |H_3(f)| |H_4(f)|$$
(Eq. 1.3-3)

### Higher Pole Correction Factors (p. 50)

$$20\log_{10}k_{r4} = 0.54 x^2 + 0.00143 x^4 \text{ (dB)}$$

Where: $x = f/f_1$ and $f_1 = c/4l_{tot}$ (quarter-wavelength frequency)

### Single Formant Contribution (p. 53)

$$|H_n(f)| = \frac{s_n \cdot s_n^*}{|(s-s_n)| \cdot |(s-s_n^*)|_{(s=j\omega)}}$$
(Eq. 1.3-5a)

$$H_n(f) = \frac{F_n^2 + (B_n/2)^2}{\sqrt{(f-F_n)^2 + (B_n/2)^2} \cdot \sqrt{(f+F_n)^2 + (B_n/2)^2}}$$
(Eq. 1.3-5b)

Where: Formant characterized by frequency $F_n = \omega_n/2\pi$ and 3-dB bandwidth $B_n = F_n/2\pi$

### Quality Factor (p. 54)

$$Q = \frac{F_n}{B_n}$$
(Eq. 1.3-6)

### Simplified Formant Response (p. 54)

For large Q:
$$|H_n(f)| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-x^2)^2 + x^2/Q^2}}$$
(Eq. 1.3-7)

Where $x = f/F_n$

For $x > \sqrt{2}$:
$$|H_n(f)| \simeq \frac{1}{x^2-1}$$
(Eq. 1.3-8)

For $x > 2$:
$$|H_n(f)| \simeq \frac{F_n^2}{f^2}$$
(Eq. 1.3-9)

At frequency $f = \sqrt{2} F_n$: resonance curve fallen to 0 dB (unity), then falls at 12 dB/octave

(Eq. 1.3-12)

Where:
- $x_{pn} = f/F_{pn}$; $Q_{pn} = F_{pn}/B_{pn}$
- $x_{zn} = f/F_{zn}$; $Q_{zn} = F_{zn}/B_{zn}$

### Pole-Zero Cancellation (p. 61)

For $f >> F_{pn}$:

(Eq. 1.4-3)

### Horn Area Function (p. 80)

$$A_x = A_{min} \cosh^2(x - x_{min})/h$$
(Eq. 1.4-4)

Where h is determined by:
$$h/4.75 = \text{arcosh}(8/A_{min})^{1/2}$$
(Eq. 1.4-5)

### Effective Constriction Length (p. 80)

$$l_e = A_{min} \int_{x_{min}-4.75}^{x_{min}+4.75} \frac{dx}{A(x)} = 2h \cdot \tanh(4.75/h)$$
(Eq. 1.4-6)

## Vocal Tract Models

### Twin-Tube Resonator (pp. 63-67)
- Two uniform tubes of different cross-sectional areas A_1 and A_2
- Lengths l_1 (front) and l_2 (back)
- Resonances found at intersections of reactance curves
- Lip-rounding adds length to front section, lowering all formants below quarter-wavelength resonance

### Horn Resonator (pp. 67-71)

## Implementation Notes

### Spectrum Calculation Pipeline
1. Start with source spectrum: -12 dB/octave slope above ~100 Hz (two poles at 100 c/s)
2. Add radiation: +6 dB/octave low frequency rise
3. Net source+radiation: -6 dB/octave slope, cutoff at 100 c/s (Eq. 1.3-2)
4. Apply higher pole correction (Eq. 1.3-4a-c) - adds ~0.5-1 dB at high frequencies
5. Multiply by four formant filters (Eq. 1.3-5b)
6. Result: complete spectrum envelope

### Formant Filter Implementation
Each formant contributes (Eq. 1.3-5b):
```
H_n(f) = (F_n^2 + (B_n/2)^2) /
         (sqrt((f-F_n)^2 + (B_n/2)^2) * sqrt((f+F_n)^2 + (B_n/2)^2))
```

For digital implementation with high Q (Q = F_n/B_n > 5):
- At f < F_n/sqrt(2): approximately unity (0 dB)
- At f = F_n: peak of Q (in linear units)
- At f > sqrt(2)*F_n: falls at 12 dB/octave (Eq. 1.3-9)

### Bandwidth Estimation
Default assumption: B = 100 c/s for all formants (may vary with F1 due to glottal coupling)
Actual B1 variations within fundamental period observable in oscillographic records.

### Nasalization Implementation
Add pole-zero pairs for each nasal formant (Eq. 1.3-12):
- If pole and zero at same frequency: complete cancellation
- If frequencies differ slightly: local spectral perturbation
- At high frequencies: converges to constant (F_pn/F_zn)^2 ratio

### Three-Parameter Articulatory Control
For real-time control of formants:
1. **Tongue position** (x coordinate, cm from glottis): Primary control of F2, affects F1/F3 proximity
2. **Constriction area** (A_3, 0.16-8 cm^2): Affects formant bandwidths and levels
3. **Lip rounding** (l_1/A_1): Lowers all formants uniformly below c/4l_1

### Vowel Intensity Rule (p. 58)
F1 shift of one octave changes total intensity by approximately 12 dB:
- Higher F1 -> higher intensity
- Lower F1 -> lower intensity

### Key Synthesis Parameters from Fig. 1.3-5
For synthesizing different vowels from neutral [schwa]:
- Lowering F1 from 500 to 250 c/s: -12 dB overall level
- Higher formants above 500 c/s: unchanged in level
- Perceptual quality completely determined by F-pattern

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The relative importance of the separate formants of voiced sounds decreases with increasing order above F2. F1 and F2 are the main determinants of vowel quality." (p. 48)

> "The number of variables may thus be reduced from the 20-40 harmonics of a harmonic specification to four formants plus source characteristics required by the theory of Laplace transforms." (p. 48)

> "It is thus not possible to increase the acoustic power of a vowel by an articulatory effort (filter function) alone without changing the phonetic quality of the vowel, as specified by the formant frequencies." (p. 69)

> "At a frequency of f = sqrt(2) F_n the resonance curve H_n(f) has fallen to the value unity, i.e., 0 dB, and at higher frequencies the curve falls off at a rate of 12 dB/octave." (p. 54)

> "The only remaining independent variables in the production of voiced sounds are thus the formant frequencies, i.e., the F-pattern." (p. 48)

> "These calculated spectra have been transcribed by the closest IPA symbols but should not be interpreted as phonetic quality norms. They demonstrate that spectrum shape and intensity levels are predictable from formant frequencies." (p. 57, Fig. 1.3-6 caption)
