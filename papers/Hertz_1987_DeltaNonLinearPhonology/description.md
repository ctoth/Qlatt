Delta is a programming language that uses multi-level synchronized "streams" to represent phonological and phonetic structures, enabling elegant expression of non-linear phenomena like tone spreading and sub-phonemic units across multiple linguistic levels (phonemes, syllables, morphs, CV structure). The paper demonstrates Delta through complete implementations of Bambara tone assignment and F0 generation, followed by three progressive models of English formant transitions showing how Delta accommodates different theoretical approaches including explicit transition durations and aspiration as an independent overlay. Delta's ability to represent formant transitions as durational units (40ms for sonorant-obstruent, 90ms for sonorant-sonorant) and aspiration independently from consonant/vowel segments provides concrete parameterizable rules directly applicable to formant synthesis, making it highly relevant for systems like Klatt that generate frame-by-frame acoustic output.
