This paper investigates the acoustic properties of American English /r/ using MRI-derived vocal tract dimensions and acoustic tube models to explain why /r/ has a characteristically low F3 (1300-1950 Hz) that cannot be predicted by perturbation theory. Key findings demonstrate that the sublingual space is critical for achieving the correct acoustic output, lowering F3 by 200-300 Hz, and that simple tube models with MRI-derived cavity dimensions can accurately predict all four formants across different articulatory configurations. For Klatt synthesis, these results provide essential targets and formant relationships showing that /r/ formants follow a central rounded vowel pattern with F3 set to 60-80% of neutral vowel F3, with trading relations allowing multiple articulatory configurations to produce equivalent acoustics.
