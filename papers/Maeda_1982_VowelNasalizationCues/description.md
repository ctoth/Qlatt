This paper presents a simulation study investigating the acoustic cues that signal vowel nasalization in French, using a vocal tract model with a nasal side cavity. The key finding is that spectral flattening in the 300-2500 Hz range, caused by nasal coupling, is the primary acoustic cue for nasalization perception, and this effect generalizes across all tested vowel qualities. For speech synthesis, this work indicates that effective nasalization requires nasal pole-zero pairs that create broadband spectral flattening across multiple formant regions rather than simply adding resonance.
