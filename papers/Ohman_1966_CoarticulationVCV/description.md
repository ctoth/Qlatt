This paper investigates coarticulation in VCV utterances by measuring formant transitions in stop consonants across different vowel contexts in Swedish, English, and Russian using spectral analysis. Ohman demonstrates that formant transitions are not characterized by fixed locus frequencies as previously proposed, but instead vary by approximately 280 Hz (F2 average) depending on both the preceding and following vowels, with evidence that VCV production can be modeled as a superimposed consonant gesture on an underlying vowel-to-vowel diphthongal gesture. These findings are directly applicable to speech synthesis, requiring that formant transition targets be made context-dependent rather than fixed, and that both anticipatory and carryover coarticulation effects be implemented to capture realistic stop consonant articulation.
