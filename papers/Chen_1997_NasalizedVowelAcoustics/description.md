This paper identifies acoustic correlates of vowel nasalization using spectral peak amplitudes (A1-P1 and A1-P0), providing objective measurements for English and French nasalized vowels across different vowel types. The key findings show that nasalization causes a 10-15 dB decrease in the A1-P1 measure for high vowels and a 6-8 dB decrease in A1-P0 for low vowels, with nasal peaks occurring at approximately 950 Hz (P1) and 220 Hz (P0). For Klatt synthesizer implementation, this directly informs nasal formant amplitude (AN) settings, first formant bandwidth increases (~107 Hz), and timing of nasalization effects through vowel segments.
