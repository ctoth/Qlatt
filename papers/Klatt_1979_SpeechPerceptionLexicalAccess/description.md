This paper presents SCRIBER and LAFS, integrated systems that model human speech perception by precompiling acoustic-phonetic and phonological knowledge into spectral-sequence decoding networks that enable direct lexical access from continuous acoustic input. The key contributions are demonstrating how coarticulatory effects can be captured through context-dependent diphone templates, how phonological rules can be encoded into recognition networks to handle word-boundary phenomena, and how 80-90% phonetic transcription accuracy can be achieved by matching spectral sequences without requiring intermediate phonetic decisions. This work is critical for speech synthesis because it establishes the principles of diphone-based targeting, formant transition modeling across coarticulation boundaries, and systematic phonological rule application for natural connected speech.
