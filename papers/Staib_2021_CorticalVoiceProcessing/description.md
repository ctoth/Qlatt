This paper investigates how the temporal voice area (TVA) in auditory cortex processes voice and non-voice sounds, demonstrating that the TVA responds to synthetic textural sound patterns that share perceptual similarity with voices rather than being exclusively selective for voice signals. Using fMRI, the authors reconstructed TVA voice-processing patterns from synthetic sounds and showed that perceptual voice similarity ratings explain significant variance in neural activation beyond acoustic features alone. For speech synthesis, this work highlights that spectral flux and other acoustic properties contributing to perceived voice similarity are important for naturalness, and suggests that synthetic speech quality should be evaluated along a perceptual similarity gradient rather than discrete voice/non-voice categories.
