This paper presents an empirical study of the acoustic features needed to synthesize identifiable vowels using the pattern playback instrument, testing 235 two-formant patterns to determine the minimum formant frequencies required for vowel perception. The key finding is that all 16 cardinal vowels can be synthesized with only F1 and F2 frequencies, though back vowels can be approximated with a single formant due to perceptual averaging of closely-spaced formants, and the authors discovered that synthetic vowels require elevated F2 values compared to natural speech to compensate for the missing third formant. This work is fundamental for speech synthesis because it establishes the precise formant targets and perceptual principles underlying vowel quality, directly applicable to formant-based synthesizers like Klatt which depend on accurate F1/F2 positioning for natural-sounding speech production.
