## One-Sentence Summary

Spectral properties of fricative noise are the dominant perceptual cue for place of articulation, not amplitude—contrary to earlier studies suggesting amplitude was primary.

## Problem Addressed

Previous research (Heinz & Stevens 1961; McCasland 1979a,b) suggested that fricative noise amplitude relative to the vowel was the *primary* characteristic distinguishing [f] from [θ] and [s] from [ʃ]. This paper tests whether amplitude truly is primary, or whether spectral cues override amplitude when they are compatible.

## Key Contributions

1. **Spectral > Amplitude:** When spectral properties of fricative noise and formant transitions are compatible, amplitude manipulations have *minimal* perceptual effect
2. **Context matters:** Amplitude effects only emerge in CV syllable context, not in isolated fricative noise
3. **Asymmetric effects:** [s] and [ʃ] identification is particularly robust—near-ceiling performance regardless of amplitude manipulation
4. **Challenges feature theory:** Questions whether a phonetic feature relating to amplitude properties appropriately characterizes the [f θ] vs [s ʃ] distinction

## Methodology

### Experiment Design
- Two male speakers of American English
- 60 fricative-vowel syllables: 4 fricatives [f θ s ʃ] × 3 vowels [i a u]
- Recorded in soundproof room (Nagra 4.2, Shure SM 81)
- Digitized: 20 kHz sampling, 10-bit, 9 kHz low-pass filter

### Key Acoustic Finding
- [f] and [θ]: Frication noise is **15–21 dB less** than vowel
- [s] and [ʃ]: Frication noise is only **2–6 dB less** than vowel (roughly equal)

### Stimuli Creation

**First Set (180 CV + 180 isolated):**
- Token-by-token matching: Each [fV] matched with corresponding [θV] token
- Scaled such that noise-vowel difference of [f] tokens = that of original [θ] tokens (and vice versa)
- Result: 360 stimuli total

**Second Set (240 CV + 120 isolated):**
- Average-based scaling: Noise scaled to match *average* ratio across vowel group
- 5 occurrences × 4 consonants × 3 vowels × 2 amplitude levels + originals

### Procedure
- 20 Brown undergrad subjects (native American English)
- 4-alternative forced choice: "f th s sh"
- Blocks of 10 stimuli, 3s between, 6s between blocks

## Key Results

### Statistical Analysis
- Two-way ANOVA (context × amplitude) for each consonant
- **[f] and [θ]:** No significant main effects of amplitude
- **[s]:** Significant context effect [F(1,9) = 14.26, p < 0.004]; amplitude [F(1,9) = 9.34, p < 0.01]
- **[ʃ]:** Significant context [F(2,18) = 13.85, p < 0.0002]; context × amplitude interaction [F(2,18) = 7.97, p < 0.003]

### Identification Accuracy (Table II - First Set)

| Stimulus | Isolation | Context (CV) |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| [f] f(s) | 28.1 | 28.9 |
| [f] f(ʃ) | 27.8 | 29.4 |
| [f] f(orig) | 28.2 | 27.0 |
| [θ] θ(s) | 26.3 | 26.5 |
| [θ] θ(ʃ) | 28.1 | 27.6 |
| [θ] θ(orig) | 28.6 | 26.3 |
| [s] s(f) | 29.3 | 18.1 |
| [s] s(θ) | 29.9 | 18.2 |
| [s] s(orig) | 29.5 | 29.1 |
| [ʃ] ʃ(f) | 29.7 | 23.3 |
| [ʃ] ʃ(θ) | 29.6 | 25.7 |
| [ʃ] ʃ(orig) | 29.9 | 29.6 |

(Scores out of 30; higher = better identification)

### Main Findings

1. **[f] and [θ]:** Amplitude manipulations have **no perceptual effect** in either isolation or CV context

2. **[s]:** Amplitude manipulations only affect perception in CV context
   - When amplitude lowered (scaled to [f]): More [θ] and [ʃ] responses
   - Performance drops from 29.1 to 18.1-18.2 in CV context
   - In isolation: No significant effect

3. **[ʃ]:** Similar pattern—effects only in CV context
   - Near-ceiling performance maintained in isolation
   - Some degradation in CV context when amplitude manipulated

4. **Critical insight:** Decreasing [s] amplitude does NOT increase [f] responses—it increases [θ] or [ʃ] responses. This means subjects respond based on spectral similarity, not amplitude matching.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Units | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| [f]/[θ] noise-to-vowel ratio | −12 to −23 | dB | Weak fricatives |
| [s]/[ʃ] noise-to-vowel ratio | −1 to −8 | dB | Strong fricatives |
| [s] spectral peak | 3.5–5 | kHz | Distinctive |
| [ʃ] spectral peak | 2.5–3.5 | kHz | Distinctive |
| [f] spectrum | 1.4–2.0 kHz peaks | kHz | Diffuse, 7–8.5 kHz energy |
| [θ] spectrum | 1.4–2.0 kHz peaks | kHz | Similar to [f], more diffuse |

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **AF (frication amplitude) setting:**
   - [f], [θ]: Should be ~15–21 dB below vowel amplitude
   - [s], [ʃ]: Should be roughly equal to vowel amplitude (within 1–8 dB)

2. **Spectral properties are primary:**
   - Getting the spectral shape right (via AH, formant frequencies, bandwidths) is MORE important than precise amplitude matching
   - Listeners can tolerate significant amplitude variation if spectrum is correct

3. **Duration effects (from Jongman 1985, cited):**
   - Shortening fricative noise to 70ms does not significantly decrease perceptual performance
   - Duration plays minimal role in place perception

### Practical Implications for TTS

- Don't obsess over exact fricative amplitude—spectral accuracy matters more
- [s] and [ʃ] are perceptually robust even with amplitude variation
- [f] and [θ] distinction relies primarily on spectral differences (formant transitions)
- In CV context, amplitude cues can cause confusion, but spectral cues dominate

## Limitations

1. Only tested voiceless fricatives (not voiced)
2. Only three vowel contexts [i a u]
3. Natural speech stimuli—not controlled synthetic stimuli
4. Authors note results differ from previous synthetic speech experiments
5. No acoustic analysis of spectral differences between [f] and [θ]

## Relevance to Qlatt Project

**High relevance for fricative synthesis tuning:**

1. **Validates current approach:** If spectral properties are correct, exact AF amplitude is less critical
2. **Priority guidance:** Focus on getting fricative spectral shapes right (source spectrum, formant tuning) before fine-tuning amplitude
3. **[s]/[ʃ] robustness:** These sibilants are perceptually forgiving—good news for synthesis
4. **[f]/[θ] challenge:** These non-sibilant fricatives rely on subtle spectral cues AND formant transitions—harder to synthesize convincingly

## Open Questions

- [ ] What specific spectral properties distinguish [f] from [θ]? (This paper doesn't analyze)
- [ ] How do formant transitions contribute when fricative noise alone is ambiguous?
- [ ] Does this apply to voiced fricatives [v ð z ʒ]?
