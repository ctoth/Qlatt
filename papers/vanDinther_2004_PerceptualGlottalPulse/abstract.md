# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This paper describes a method for analysing the perceptual relevance of parameter variations of the Liljencrants–Fant (LF) model for the glottal pulse. A perceptual distance measure based on excitation patterns was developed and evaluated in order to predict audibility discrimination thresholds for small changes to the R-parameters of the LF model. For a number of R-parameter sets, taken from real source data, an approximation Q of the distance measure was used to compute the directions of maximal and minimal perceptual sensitivity. In addition, we show that the inverse of Q can be used to calculate the amount of variation of the R-parameters to reach a just noticeable difference (JND). The results were evaluated in a listening test in which JNDs for R-parameter changes were measured. Discrimination thresholds were fairly constant across all tested conditions and corresponded on average to an excitation pattern distance of 4.3 dB. An additional error analysis demonstrated that Q is a fair approximation of the perceptual distance measure for small variations of the R-parameters up to one just noticeable difference.

## Our Interpretation

This paper develops a perceptual distance measure (based on excitation patterns) to predict how audible LF glottal source parameter variations are to human listeners, establishing that discrimination thresholds cluster around 4.3 dB on the excitation pattern distance scale. The work provides a practical method to quantify voice quality changes from LF parameter modifications and validates that small parameter variations can be predicted using a computationally efficient quadratic approximation, enabling efficient perceptual optimization of glottal source models in speech synthesis systems.
