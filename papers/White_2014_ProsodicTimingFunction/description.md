This paper presents a functional framework for prosodic timing in English, arguing that durational variation serves communicative purposes only through localized lengthening effects at domain heads and edges rather than through compensatory shortening or diffuse rhythmic processes. White identifies four primary lengthening effects (word-initial, phrase-final, lexical stress, and phrasal accent), each with a distinct structural locus and perceptual function, and reinterprets apparent polysyllabic shortening as the distributed attenuation of lengthening when multiple segments share prosodic emphasis. For speech synthesis, this framework provides a parsimonious model for duration control that replaces complex compensatory rules with localized lengthening effects positioned to disambiguate prosodic structure for listeners.
