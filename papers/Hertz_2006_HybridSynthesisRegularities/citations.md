## Key Citations for Follow-up

- **[4] Hertz & Huffman 1992 (Nucleus-based timing model)** — Directly relevant for understanding timing patterns in consonant and vowel structure, foundational to the hybrid model framework.

- **[5] Hertz et al. 1999 (ETI-Eloquence multilanguage synthesis)** — Implementation of rule-based formant synthesis across multiple languages; critical for rule-based consonant generation strategies.

- **[3] Hertz 1991 (Streams, phones, and transitions)** — Theoretical foundation for the phone-and-transition (P&T) model underlying the hybrid model; essential for understanding formant transitions in speech organization.

- **[7] Klatt & Klatt 1990 (Voice quality variations)** — Classic reference on perceptual dimensions of voice quality; relates to how acoustic nuclei encode speaker identity despite formant substitution.

- **[2] Pierrehumbert 2000 (Exemplar dynamics)** — Contrasting view on how listeners process speech; important for understanding the rules-vs-exemplars debate that motivates this work.
