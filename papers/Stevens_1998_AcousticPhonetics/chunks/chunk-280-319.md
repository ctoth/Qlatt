## Key Findings

### Vowel Classification System (Table 6.1, p.284)
- Six basic vowels classified by three binary features: [high], [low], [back]
- /i/: [+high, -low, -back]
- /e/: [-high, -low, -back]
- /ae/: [-high, +low, -back]
- /a/: [-high, +low, +back]
- /o/: [-high, -low, +back]
- /u/: [+high, -low, +back]
- Many languages have 5-vowel system (no front-back distinction for low vowels)

### Front-Back Acoustic Distinction (p.283)
- Forward tongue movement increases F2 to maximum value consistent with tongue height
- Maximum F2 is higher for high vowels than low vowels
- Front vowels: characterized by "empty space" (broad minimum) between F1 and F2
- Back vowels: F2 displaced to value close to F1 (maximally low)
- Back vowels with low F2: higher frequency peaks (F3, F4) have low amplitude relative to F1/F2

### Perturbation Theory for Vowels (p.285-286)
- Uniform tube with length 17.7 cm produces formants at c/4l, 3c/4l, 5c/4l
- Narrowing front portion: lowers F1, raises F2 (toward /i/)
- Narrowing back portion: raises F1, lowers F2 (toward /a/)
- Constriction at midpoint: corresponds roughly to high back vowel position

### Four Constriction Locations (Wood 1979, p.286)
1. Palatal constriction (as in /i/)
2. Constriction in vicinity of soft palate (as in /u/)
3. Lower pharyngeal region (as in /a/ and /ae/)
4. Upper pharyngeal region (as in /o/)
- When constriction is at these locations, F1 and F2 tend to be minimally sensitive to perturbations

### Bark Scale Spacing (p.287-288)
- F2-F1 spacing: 2.1-4.7 bark for back vowels
- B3-B2 spacing: 1.1-2.3 bark for front vowels
- Front vowel distinguishing attribute: spacing between B2 and B3 is 3.0-3.5 bark or less
- B1-B0 difference: 0.8-1.6 bark for high vowels, >3.0 bark for non-high vowels
- Critical spacing of ~3.0 bark between F1 and higher formants provides perceptual boundary

### Equivalent F2' (F2-prime) Concept (p.289-290)
- For front vowels: F2' is an "effective high-frequency center of gravity" formed by F2, F3, F4
- For back vowels: two-formant synthetic vowel achieves same quality by locating F1 and F2 at the same frequencies (F2' = F2)
- Front vowel /i/, /e/: F2 and F3 (and F4 for /i/) combine to form spectral prominence
- Perception experiments show front vowels can be synthesized with single F2' replacing higher formants

### Lip Rounding Effects (p.290-292)
- Rounding decreases cross-sectional area at anterior end
- Lengthens front cavity
- Acoustic consequence: lowers natural frequencies of front-cavity resonances
- For high front vowel /i/: rounding lowers F2, F3, F4 (see Fig 6.20)
- For rounded back vowels: F1 and F2 closer together, more prominent low-frequency peak
- Rounded vowel: center of gravity of spectral peak is at lower frequency

### Tense-Lax Distinction (p.294-297)
- Tense (peripheral) vowels: extreme tongue positions, more extreme formant values
- Lax (non-peripheral) vowels: less extreme positions, formants closer to neutral
- Feature [ATR] (advanced tongue root) sometimes used for this contrast
- Tense vowels tend to be longer than lax cognates
- Tense vowels /i/, /e/ diphthongized toward extreme high front position
- Lax vowels move toward more central position

### Tense vs Lax Formant Patterns (Fig 6.24, p.296)
- Tense vowels form outer quadrilateral in F1-F2 plane
- Movement from tense to lax: inward F1 and F2 shift toward center
- High vowels: smaller F1 shift, larger F2 shift
- Non-low vowels: larger changes overall

### Acoustic Correlates of Tense-Lax (p.297)
- For non-low vowels: F1 is higher for tense than lax vowels
- Spectral prominences above F1 tend to be greater for tense vowels
- Glottal source modifications can enhance contrast:
  - Breathy/spread glottal: reduces high-frequency spectrum amplitude (for tense)
  - Pressed glottal: enhances high-frequency amplitude (for lax)
- Additional loading on vocal tract can increase F1 bandwidth for tense vowels

### Subglottal Coupling Effects (p.300-303)
- Subglottal natural frequencies (closed glottis): ~700, 1650, 2350 Hz (female); ~600, 1550, 2200 Hz (male)
- When F2 is near subglottal resonance (~1400 Hz), spectral perturbations occur
- Extra prominence appears around 1400-1800 Hz due to second subglottal resonance
- If second subglottal resonance is removed, additional prominence of 4-8 dB would appear
- Pole-zero spacing of ~200 Hz for bandwidths of 200 Hz
- This subglottal resonance effect provides natural division between front and back vowels

### Nasalization of Vowels - Theory (p.303-312)
- Velopharyngeal opening creates acoustic path to nasal cavity
- Nasal cavity natural frequencies: ~500 Hz and ~2000 Hz (adult speaker)
- Introduces additional pole-zero pairs in transfer function

### Nasalization Key Parameters
- Additional resonances at ~400 Hz and ~1300 Hz from sinus coupling
- Nasal formant Fn typically between F1 and F2
- F1n (nasalized first formant) shifts upward for high vowels, downward for low vowels
- Bandwidth of F1 increases for nasal vowel (adds ~100-200 Hz to F1 bandwidth)
- Extra zero fz introduced near nasal formant frequency

### Transfer Function for Nasalized Vowels (Eq 6.3, p.307)
$$T(s) = a \frac{(s - s_m)(s - s_m^*)}{s_m s_m^*} \cdot P(s) + (1-a) \frac{(s - s_n)(s - s_n^*)}{s_n s_n^*} \cdot P(s)$$

Where:
- $s_m = j2\pi f_m$, $s_n = j2\pi f_n$
- P(s) is an all-pole component
- a accounts for division between nasal and oral paths
- Normalized so P(s) = 1 for s = 0

### Frequency of Lowest Zero (Eq 6.4, p.308)
$$f_z = f_m \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{M_m}{M_n}}{1 + \left(\frac{f_m}{f_n}\right)^2 \frac{M_m}{M_n}}}$$

- Ratio fz/fm generally lies between 1.1 and 1.4 for nasalized vowels
- For large mouth opening: fz approaches fm
- For nasal consonant (closed oral cavity): fz = fn

## Equations Found

### Transfer Function for Nasalized Vowel (p.307)
$$T(s) = a \frac{(s - s_m)(s - s_m^*)}{s_m s_m^*} \cdot P(s) + (1-a) \frac{(s - s_n)(s - s_n^*)}{s_n s_n^*} \cdot P(s)$$

### Frequency of Lowest Zero in Nasalized Transfer Function (p.308)
$$f_z = f_m \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{M_m}{M_n}}{1 + \left(\frac{f_m}{f_n}\right)^2 \frac{M_m}{M_n}}}$$

Where:
- $f_m$ = frequency of lowest zero of mouth output
- $f_n$ = frequency of nose output zero
- $M_m$ = acoustic mass of oral path
- $M_n$ = acoustic mass of nasal path

## Rules/Algorithms

### Vowel Front-Back Rule
1. Forward tongue body displacement causes F2 to increase toward maximum
2. Maximum F2 value is higher for high vowels than low vowels
3. For high front position: F2 approaches F3 (and F4 for /i/)
4. For back position: F2 approaches F1 (maximally low)

### Rounding Effects Rule
1. Lip rounding decreases cross-sectional area at mouth
2. Lengthens the front cavity
3. Acoustic effect: lowers all front-cavity resonance frequencies
4. For back vowels: brings F1 and F2 closer together
5. F3 bandwidth decreases with rounding (due to reduced radiation resistance)

### Nasalization Implementation Rule
1. Open velopharyngeal port introduces additional poles and zeros
2. Primary effect: introduces nasal formant Fn between F1 and F2
3. Introduces zero fz near but above Fn
4. Widens F1 bandwidth by 100-200 Hz
5. For high vowels (/i/): F1n shifts upward, larger Fn-fz separation
6. For low vowels (/ae/): F1n shifts downward, smaller Fn-fz separation
7. Zero frequency fz = fn when oral cavity is completely closed (nasal consonant)

### Tense-Lax Formant Adjustment Rule
1. Tense vowels: formants at more extreme positions (outer quadrilateral)
2. Lax vowels: formants shifted toward center of vowel space
3. For high vowels: F1 difference is small (0.8-1.6 bark)
4. For non-high vowels: F1 difference is larger (>3.0 bark)
5. Duration: tense vowels are typically longer than lax cognates

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Forward movement of the tongue body causes an increase of the second-formant frequency to a maximum value consistent with the types of constrictions that are possible for the different tongue heights. This maximum value is higher for the high vowels than for the low vowels." (p.283)

> "Front vowels, then, are always characterized by a broad minimum or 'empty space' in the spectrum in the mid-frequency range between F1 and F2." (p.283)

> "For a backed tongue body, on the other hand, F2 is displaced to a value that is maximally low and close to F1 for a proper selection of the tongue body position." (p.283)

> "A distinguishing attribute of front vowels, then, is a spacing between B2 and B3 that is considerably less, on average, than the critical spacing of 3.0 to 3.5 bark proposed by Chistovich and her colleagues." (p.287)

> "The ratio fz/fm generally lies between 1.1 and 1.4 for nasalized vowels, as we shall observe." (p.308)

> "A general observation that applies to the calculated transfer functions for both front and back nasal vowels is that the spectrum shape at low frequencies (up to, say, 1200 Hz) is flatter and does not contain narrow or dominant spectral prominences." (p.316)

> "The overall effect of nasalization for these French vowels is a lack of prominent spectral peaks in the frequency range up to 1500 Hz. This general property of the spectra of nasal vowels has been noted by Maeda (1982a)." (p.321)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer - Vowel Targets

**Critical F1-F2 relationships:**
- Front vowels: Large F2-F1 spacing (empty mid-frequency region)
- Back vowels: Small F2-F1 spacing (F2 close to F1)
- High vowels: Low F1, more stable across front-back dimension
- Low vowels: High F1, sensitive to front-back position

**Rounding implementation:**
- Rounding lowers F2, F3, F4 for front vowels
- Rounding brings F1 and F2 closer for back vowels
- Rounding decreases F3 bandwidth (narrower peak)
- Consider separate rounded/unrounded targets or interpolation

**Tense-Lax implementation:**
- Tense vowels: more extreme formant positions (outer quadrilateral)
- Lax vowels: formants shifted toward schwa
- Tense vowels: longer duration
- Consider implementing as offset from tense targets toward center

### For Nasalization Implementation

**Key acoustic effects to model:**
1. **Add nasal formant Fn** between F1 and F2:
   - High vowels: Fn around 1020 Hz for /i/, 990 Hz for /ae/
   - Back vowels: Fn around 730-910 Hz

2. **Add nasal zero fz** slightly above Fn:
   - fz/fm ratio: 1.1-1.4
   - Separation increases with velopharyngeal opening

3. **Widen F1 bandwidth** by 100-200 Hz

4. **F1n shift:**
   - For /i/: F1n shifts upward
   - For /ae/, /a/: F1n shifts downward

5. **Spectral flattening below 1200 Hz** - lack of prominent narrow peaks

**Velopharyngeal opening area effects:**
- Small opening (0.3 cm^2): subtle nasalization
- Large opening (0.8 cm^2): strong nasalization
- Controls relative amplitude of nasal vs oral output

**Anticipatory nasalization:**
- In CV sequences with nasal consonant, velopharyngeal port opens during preceding vowel
- Nasalization increases toward consonant closure
- Pole-zero separation increases as opening grows

### For Subglottal Coupling

**Implement only if high accuracy needed:**
- Subglottal resonances at ~600-700, 1550-1650, 2200-2350 Hz
- Creates extra spectral prominence around 1400-1800 Hz
- Most noticeable when F2 is near 1400 Hz (dividing line between front/back vowels)
- Effect is more prominent with breathy voice quality
- Can mostly ignore for modal voice synthesis

### Bark Scale Critical Distances

For perceptual accuracy:
- F2-F1 spacing > 3.5 bark: front vowel quality
- F2-F1 spacing < 3.0 bark: back vowel quality
- B3-B2 spacing < 3.0 bark: front vowel "merged" high-frequency prominence
- B1-B0 spacing < 1.6 bark: high vowel quality
