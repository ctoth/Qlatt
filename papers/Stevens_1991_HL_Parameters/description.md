This paper presents a 10-parameter higher-level control system for the Klatt synthesizer that maps articulatory and aerodynamic parameters to the 40+ low-level Klatt parameters, automatically incorporating physical production constraints. The key contribution demonstrates that stop consonants and nasals with the same articulation differ only in 2-3 higher-level parameters, and provides explicit aerodynamic calculations for airflow, pressure, and noise sources that derive complex Klatt timing automatically. This framework is critical for speech synthesis because it reduces the control complexity from 40+ interdependent parameters to 10 intuitive articulatory-acoustic parameters, making formant synthesis practical and enabling analysis-by-synthesis approaches for matching natural speech.
