## Key Findings

### Voice Quality Perception (Chapter 5 conclusion)
- When glottal parameters are varied across tokens, listeners perceive voice quality differences
- Glottal parameters contribute to overall voice quality but are overpowered by formant frequencies and pitch contours
- A single set of glottal parameters cannot describe all speakers; different speakers need different parameter sets
- **Spectral tilt (TL) correctly predicts preferred test item in almost every case** - most influential parameter
- **High-frequency aspiration noise (AH) and first-formant bandwidth (B1)** are moderate predictors
- **Open quotient (OQ) is NOT a good predictor** of voice quality preference
- Breathy voice quality preferred for Group 2 speakers; pressed/modal quality preferred for Group 1
- Acoustic measures H1* - H2* (first two harmonics difference) has little effect on perceived breathiness

### Two Groups of Speakers Based on Glottal Configuration
- **Group 1:** Abrupt glottal closures along entire length of vocal folds (cartilaginous part)
  - Narrower first-formant bandwidths
  - Relatively shallow spectral tilts
  - Complete closures, small openings at arytenoid cartilages

- **Group 2:** Non-simultaneous glottal closures, posterior openings extending beyond vocal fold processes
  - Wider bandwidths
  - Steeper spectral tilts
  - Posterior end of glottis extends into membranous part of folds
  - More open glottal configuration
  - Perceived as more breathy

### Physiological Validation
- Group 2 speakers had higher minimum airflows (larger glottal openings)
- Higher values of open quotient (H1* - H2*) correlated with greater speed quotients
- Lower measures of spectral tilt (H1* - A3*) found in speakers with greater speed quotients

### Synthesis Test Results (Table 5.4)
For preferred glottal parameter sets Gi matching synthesized GM:
| Subject | Word | Preferred Ti | OQ | TL | B1 | AH |
|---------|------|--------------|----|----|----|----|
| F9 | bud | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 |
| F9 | bed | 2,3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 |
| F13 | bud | 1,2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| F13 | bed | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| F18 | bud | 2,3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 1 |
| F18 | bed | 2,3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| F2 | bud | 5 | 1 | 5 | 6 | 2 |
| F2 | bed | 5,6 | 1 | 5 | 6 | 4 |
| F10 | bud | 5,6 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 1 |
| F10 | bed | 5 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 4 |
| F15 | bud | 5 | 4 | 4 | 6 | 5 |
| F15 | bed | 6 | 2 | 5 | 6 | 6 |

**Key insight:** TL (spectral tilt) correctly predicts preferred set in almost every case.

### Summary of Findings (Chapter 6)
- Voice source descriptors developed from speech spectrum measurements using simple microphone recordings
- Two factors affect spectrum: presence/size of posterior glottal opening, and abruptness of vocal fold closure
- Acoustic measures based on spectrum can classify speakers according to glottal configuration
- Three spectral measures strongly correlated with breathiness ratings:
  1. **Spectral tilt (H1* - A3*)**
  2. **First-formant bandwidth (H1* - A1)**
  3. **High-frequency aspiration noise (Ns)**
- Measure of aspiration noise strongly correlated with spectral tilt (p > 0.70)
- Spectrum-based bandwidth measure also good correlation with spectral tilt and noise (p > 0.65)

### Suggestions for Future Work
- Investigate spectrum-based first-formant bandwidth instead of waveform-based measure
- Examine parameter variation throughout utterances (consonant/vowel transitions)
- Glottal configuration during consonants can influence vowel edges
- Study effects of prosody on glottal parameters
- Apply measures to male speakers
- Study speakers with voice disorders

## Equations Found

### Appendix A: Corrections to Spectral Measures

#### A.1: Correction for F1 effect on H1 and H2

Vocal tract transfer function (all-pole model):
$$T(s) = K \frac{s_1 s_1^*}{(s-s_1)(s-s_1^*)} \cdot \frac{s_2 s_2^*}{(s-s_2)(s-s_2^*)} \cdots$$
(Eqn A.1)

where $K$ is a constant, $s = \sigma + j\omega$, and $s_n = \sigma_n + j2\pi F_n$, $F_n$ being the nth formant frequency.

When $\sigma = 0$ and $0 \leq \omega < 2\pi F_1$:
$$|T(s)| \approx \frac{s_1 s_1^*}{|(j\omega - s_1)(j\omega - s_1^*)|}$$
(Eqn A.2)

For frequencies sufficiently smaller than F1, assuming $\sigma_1^2 \ll [2\pi(F_1 - f)]^2$, i.e., $\sigma_1 \approx 0$:
$$|T(f)| \approx \frac{F_1^2}{F_1^2 - f^2}$$
(Eqn A.3)

**Correction to subtract from H1 and H2:**
$$20\log_{10}\frac{F_1^2}{F_1^2 - f^2}$$
(Eqn A.4)

where $f = F_0$ for H1 and $f = 2F_0$ for H2.

#### A.2: Correction for F1 and F2 effect on A3

For F1 and F2 sufficiently less than F3, assuming $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2 \approx 0$:
$$|T(s)| \approx \frac{s_1 s_1^*}{|(\omega - s_1)(\omega - s_1^*)|} \cdot \frac{s_2 s_2^*}{|(\omega - s_2)(\omega - s_2^*)|} \cdot \frac{s_3 s_3^*}{|(j2\pi F_3 - s_3)(j2\pi F_3 - s_3^*)|}$$
(Eqn A.5)

$$|T(s = j2\pi F_3)| \approx \frac{F_1^2}{(F_1^2 - F_3^2)} \cdot \frac{F_2^2}{(F_2^2 - F_3^2)} \cdot \frac{s_3 s_3^*}{|(j2\pi F_3 - s_3)(j2\pi F_3 - s_3^*)|}$$
(Eqn A.6)

To neutralize F3 magnitude across vowels, factor out F1 and F2 effects:
$$\frac{(F_1^2 - F_3^2)(F_2^2 - F_3^2)}{F_1^2 F_2^2} \cdot \frac{\bar{F_1}^2 \bar{F_2}^2}{(\bar{F_1}^2 - F_3^2)(\bar{F_2}^2 - F_3^2)}$$
(Eqn A.7)

which reduces to:
$$\frac{\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{F_1}\right)^2\right]\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{F_2}\right)^2\right]}{\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{\bar{F_1}}\right)^2\right]\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{\bar{F_2}}\right)^2\right]}$$
(Eqn A.8)

**Correction to add to A3:**
$$20\log_{10}\left(\frac{\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{\bar{F_1}}\right)^2\right]\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{\bar{F_2}}\right)^2\right]}{\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{F_1}\right)^2\right]\left[1 - \left(\frac{F_3}{F_2}\right)^2\right]}\right)$$
(Eqn A.9)

where $\bar{F_1}$ and $\bar{F_2}$ are neutral reference formant frequencies.

## Algorithms/Methods

### Spectral Correction Procedure (Appendix A)
1. For H1 and H2 amplitude measurements:
   - Calculate correction factor: $20\log_{10}\frac{F_1^2}{F_1^2 - f^2}$
   - Subtract this from raw H1 (f = F0) and H2 (f = 2F0) measurements
   - Results in H1* and H2* (corrected for F1 influence)

2. For A3 amplitude measurements:
   - Calculate correction using Equation A.9
   - Add correction to raw A3 measurement
   - Use neutral reference formants $\bar{F_1}$ and $\bar{F_2}$

### Voice Quality Synthesis Test Procedure (Appendix B)
1. Present AXB test format: token A - reference X - token B
2. Reference X is natural speech from one of six women
3. A and B are synthesized versions with different glottal parameters
4. Listener chooses which (A or B) better matches X in voice quality
5. Voice quality continuum: very breathy to very pressed
6. Pressed phonation: intense, sharp, clear
7. Breathy phonation: less intense, noisy, muffled
8. Stimuli presented in groups of six, 3.5 seconds between stimuli, 5 seconds between groups

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Implementation

1. **Spectral tilt (TL) is the most important parameter for voice quality:**
   - Use TL parameter to control breathiness perception
   - Default Klatt values may not capture individual speaker differences
   - Consider speaker-specific TL settings for natural-sounding synthesis

2. **First-formant bandwidth (B1) affects breathiness:**
   - Wider B1 = more breathy sound
   - Group 2 (breathy) speakers had wider bandwidths
   - Consider increasing B1 for breathy voice synthesis

3. **High-frequency aspiration noise (AH) is a moderate contributor:**
   - Add aspiration noise for breathy voices
   - Correlates with spectral tilt (p > 0.70)

4. **Open quotient (OQ) is NOT a good perceptual predictor:**
   - Despite being a common voice source parameter
   - Listeners don't perceive OQ changes as strongly as TL changes
   - Focus on TL rather than OQ for voice quality control

5. **Spectral corrections for measurements:**
   - H1 and H2 need correction for F1 influence (subtract factor)
   - A3 needs correction for F1 and F2 influence (add factor)
   - Use equations A.4 and A.9 for accurate voice source analysis

6. **Two-group classification for female speakers:**
   - Group 1: Pressed/modal (narrow B1, shallow tilt)
   - Group 2: Breathy (wide B1, steep tilt)
   - Synthesizer parameters should vary based on target voice type

7. **Parameter variation in continuous speech:**
   - Glottal parameters should vary during consonant/vowel transitions
   - Consonant configuration can influence adjacent vowel voice quality
   - Consider dynamic parameter trajectories, not just steady-state values
