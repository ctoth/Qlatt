This paper develops closed-form frequency-domain equations for the LF glottal source model that eliminate aliasing distortion when generating discrete-time voice source waveforms through a five-step process of Laplace transform derivation and spectrum sampling. The key contribution is a complete mathematical framework combining open and return phase spectra via phasor arithmetic, enabling alias-free generation of glottal pulses without anti-aliasing filters or post-processing. For speech synthesis, this method provides a more sophisticated and accurate voice source model that controls voice quality through a single Rd parameter and maintains spectral fidelity across varying fundamental frequencies and sampling rates.
