## Key Findings

### ToBI Definition and Purpose
- ToBI = Tones and Break Indices
- A prosodic annotation system for transcribing phonological aspects of prosody at the level of phonology
- Based on the Autosegmental-Metrical (AM) model of intonational phonology
- Originally designed for Mainstream American English (MAE_ToBI), now extended to ~50 languages

### The AM Model Framework
- Intonation contour analyzed as linear sequence of high (H) and low (L) tones
- Tones can be associated with:
  - Specific syllable or mora (pitch accent) - marked with *
  - Edge of prosodic unit (boundary tone) - marked with % (IP) or - (ip)
- Three prosodic units defined by intonation:
  - **Intonational Phrase (IP)** - largest unit
  - **intermediate phrase (ip)** - smaller than IP
  - **Accentual Phrase (AP)** - slightly larger than a word

### Prosodic Hierarchy (Figure 1, p.153)
```
        IP
       /  \
      ip   (ip)
     /  \
    AP   (AP)
   /  \
  w    (w)
 /
s(S) ... s
 |
(Ta) (T*)    (Ta)    (T-) T%
```

### Core ToBI Tiers
1. **Words tier**: Orthographic transcription aligned with acoustic signal
2. **Tones tier**: Distinctive tonal events (pitch accents, boundary tones)
3. **Break Indices (BIs) tier**: Perceived degree of juncture between words (0-4 scale)
4. **Miscellaneous tier**: Comments, silence, breaths, disfluencies

### Break Index Scale (MAE_ToBI)
- **0**: Smaller than typical word boundary (cliticization, coalescence)
- **1**: Typical phrase-medial word boundary
- **2**: Mismatch between tonal cue and juncture (no tone but ip/IP boundary, or weaker juncture with clear tone)
- **3**: ip boundary (juncture corresponding to intermediate phrase)
- **4**: IP boundary (juncture corresponding to Intonational Phrase)

### English ToBI Pitch Accents (MAE_ToBI)
- **H\***: Simple high pitch accent
- **L\***: Simple low pitch accent
- **L+H\***: Rising tone with F0 valley on accented syllable, F0 peak on following syllable
- **L\*+H**: Rising tone with F0 valley on accented syllable, F0 peak on immediately following syllable
- **H+!H\***: Fall from high to mid target (downstepped H)

### Downstep Convention
- **!** (exclamation mark): Downstep diacritic before H to indicate reduced pitch range
- **!H\***, **L+!H\***, **L\*+!H\***, **!H+!H\*** - downstepped versions
- **!H-**: Downstepped version of H phrase accent

### Boundary Tones
- **L-L%**: Low ip boundary followed by low IP boundary (declarative, typically)
- **H-H%**: High ip boundary followed by high IP boundary (yes-no question)
- **L-H%**: Low ip boundary followed by high IP boundary (continuation rise)
- **H-L%**: High ip boundary followed by low IP boundary

### Tone-Text Alignment
- L*-type tones: F0 minimum aligned with accented syllable
- H*-type tones: F0 maximum aligned with accented syllable
- Boundary tones: Aligned with end of relevant prosodic unit

### Interpolation Rules
- F0 contour between tonal targets filled by interpolation
- In English, interpolation does NOT occur between pitch accent and boundary tone in same way as between two pitch accents
- Target-interpolation rule explains F0 over toneless syllables

## Parameters Found

### Pitch Range Parameters
- **HiF0**: Tag for highest F0 point among pitch accents within an ip (used for discourse analysis)
- **%reset**: Pitch range reset after disfluency
- **%e-prom**: Local expansion of pitch range within phrase due to emphatic prominence
- **%compressed**: Local compression of pitch range after %e-prom

### Timing Parameters
- **<**: Delayed F0 peak (later than expected tone-text alignment)
- **>**: Early F0 peak (earlier than expected tone-text alignment)

### Prominence Parameters
- Metrical prominence marked at three levels in English ToBI (Beckman & Edwards 1994):
  - NPA (Nuclear Pitch Accent)
  - pitch accent
  - no accent
- NPA is the last pitch accent within an ip

### Uncertainty Markers
- **-** after BI: Uncertain about juncture degree (e.g., 4- means "BI ambiguous between 3 and 4")
- **\*?**: Uncertain whether syllable is pitch accented
- **X\*?**: Sure about pitch accent presence but not type
- **-?** and **X%?**: Same for phrase accents and IP boundary tones

## Rules/Algorithms

### F0 Interpolation (Pierrehumbert 1980)
- Monotonic interpolation functions connect phonological tones
- Increasing functions only increase; decreasing functions only decrease
- Exception: "sagging" interpolation between two H tones when second H is not lower
- Exception: "bulging" interpolation (Dilley & Heffner 2013)

### Downstep Rule
- H tones realized in reduced pitch range after preceding bitonal pitch accent within same ip
- Original: H → !H / H*+L ___
- MAE_ToBI revised: H+L* → H+!H* (fall from high to mid, not high to low)

### Pitch Scaling Rules (from Pierrehumbert 1980, discussed in Commentary)
- Complex phonetic rules for tone heights
- Reference line mechanism for scaling relative tone heights
- Parameters *n* and *k* for phonetic interpretation (lacked clear phonetic meaning)

### RaP (Rhythm and Pitch) Transcription System
- Separates pitch information from rhythmic/metrical information
- **Pitch tier**: Three tonal targets (H, L, E where E = equal to previous)
- **Rhythm tier**: Three metrical prominence levels (strong, weak, none)
- Prosodic structure in two levels: IP and ip

### AM+ Theory (Enhanced AM)
- Proposes both syntagmatic AND paradigmatic aspects of tone in phonology
- Syntagmatic features: [+/- same] (same vs different from previous tone), [+/- higher]
- **H** = [-same, +higher] (higher than previous tone)
- **L** = [-same, -higher] (lower than previous tone)
- **E** = [+same] (equal to previous tone)
- Paradigmatic features: T/r relationship (tone level vs speaker's mean pitch)
  - High tone: T/r = [-same, +higher]
  - Low tone: T/r = [-same, -higher]
  - Mid tone: T/r = [+same]

## Quotes Worth Preserving

From Jun (Chapter 4):
> "ToBI, which stands for tones and break indices, is the most well-known annotation system for prosody at the level of phonology."

> "The tone labels used in the ToBI system of a specific language are meant to represent underlying tonal targets that are both meaningful to native speakers of the language and systematic and consistent across native speakers of the language variety."

> "A ToBI transcription therefore requires an audio recording of an utterance and a record of the F0 contour, aligned with symbolic labels written on four parallel quasi-independent tiers."

> "ToBI is a valuable tool for conducting research on prosody, and it is a powerful and flexible transcription system."

From Dilley & Breen (Commentary):
> "The core theoretic ideas behind ToBI* were put forward in groundbreaking, well-cited PhD dissertations at MIT by Goldsmith (1976), Pierrehumbert (1980), and Liberman (1975), which formed the core ideas in what has come to be known as autosegmental-metrical (AM) theory."

> "Tones are autonomous from segments: That tones are autonomous from segmental structures but temporally coordinated with them was a foundational idea for the field of intonational phonology."

> "Surface intonation contours reflect sparse tonal representations: Another core idea highlighted by Jun is the idea that tones are sparse, for example, they do not occur on every syllable and are connected via F0 interpolations."

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody Generation

1. **Prosodic Phrasing**:
   - Mark IP boundaries with major pitch reset and preboundary lengthening
   - Mark ip boundaries with smaller pitch effects
   - Break index values can guide pause duration and boundary strength

2. **Pitch Accent Assignment**:
   - Content words typically receive pitch accents
   - Function words typically unaccented (BI 0 or 1)
   - Nuclear pitch accent (NPA) = last pitch accent in ip, most prominent

3. **F0 Generation from ToBI Labels**:
   - Map H* to local F0 maximum on accented syllable
   - Map L* to local F0 minimum on accented syllable
   - Interpolate between targets using monotonic functions (mostly)
   - Apply downstep after H+L or similar contexts

4. **Boundary Tone Implementation**:
   - L-L%: Fall to low at phrase end (declarative default)
   - H-H%: Rise to high at phrase end (yes-no questions)
   - L-H%: Low phrase accent + high boundary (continuation)

5. **Pitch Range**:
   - Track running pitch range for downstep implementation
   - Reset pitch range at IP boundaries
   - Consider declination over utterance

### Language-Specific Considerations
- Break index numbers vary across ToBI systems (Cantonese: only IP level; Pan-Mandarin: 6 BI numbers)
- Tone inventory varies (lexical tones in Mandarin/Cantonese vs postlexical in English)
- Some languages (Korean, Mongolian, West Greenlandic) are "headless" - no word-level lexical prosody
- Edge-prominence vs head-prominence typology affects pitch accent distribution

### Challenges Noted
- Prosodic categories limited to IP level (no marking of discourse-level prosody)
- Not optimized for global/gradual prosodic events
- Variability in acoustic realization of categories
- Labeler perception influences annotation
- Different ToBI systems use different levels of abstraction
- Cross-language comparison complicated by different symbol inventories
