Pierrehumbert (1980) presents a phonological and phonetic model of English intonation based on a finite-state grammar that generates all observed English tonal patterns from just two fundamental tones (H for High, L for Low) combined as pitch accents, phrase accents, and boundary tones. The key contribution is a set of local, left-to-right implementation rules including downstep (exponential decay with coefficient k≈0.6), upstep (logarithmic rise), baseline declination, and tone spreading that map these abstract tone sequences to concrete F0 contours that vary naturally across speakers and pitch ranges. This work is foundational for modern speech synthesis, providing the theoretical basis for ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) annotation and enabling TTS systems to generate natural-sounding prosody through compositional rules that require no lookahead and depend only on immediately preceding tonal values.
