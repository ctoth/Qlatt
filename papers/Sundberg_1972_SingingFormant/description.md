This paper explains the acoustic and articulatory mechanisms behind the "singing formant," a characteristic spectral peak near 3 kHz that allows professional opera singers to project their voice over an orchestra. Sundberg demonstrates through X-ray tomography and acoustic modeling that the singing formant arises from the lowered larynx acting as a Helmholtz resonator, combined with a spectral zero created by the sinus piriformes, resulting in approximately 20 dB of spectral gain in the 3 kHz region. Understanding the singing formant provides insights into vocal tract coupling and formant compression that could inform voice quality modifications and higher formant behavior in speech synthesis systems.
