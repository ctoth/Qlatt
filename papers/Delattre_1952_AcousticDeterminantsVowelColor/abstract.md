# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This paper will report the results of an attempt to synthesize the 16 cardinal vowels of the International Phonetic Association by converting hand-painted spectrographic patterns into sound. The conversion from spectrogram to sound is accomplished with a special-purpose instrument (called a pattern playback) which, by making it possible to listen to spectrograms, provides a basis for evaluating the effects of a wide variety of experimental modifications in the acoustic pattern, and thus affords a convenient method for determining the role of various acoustic features in the perception of speech. This method is most appropriate, perhaps, for investigating the dynamic, or constantly varying, aspects of speech sounds; it is not primarily designed, nor is it necessarily ideally suited, for work with steady-state vowels, though it can be used, as it has been in this study, for that purpose.

## Our Interpretation

This foundational paper establishes that all 16 cardinal vowels can be synthesized with only two formants (F1 and F2), and demonstrates that the ear perceptually "averages" formants that are close together in back vowels, making them effectively single-formant sounds. The research reveals that synthetic vowels require elevated F2 values compared to natural speech because they must compensate perceptually for the missing third formant, providing essential empirical targets and acoustic principles directly applicable to formant-based speech synthesis systems like Klatt.
