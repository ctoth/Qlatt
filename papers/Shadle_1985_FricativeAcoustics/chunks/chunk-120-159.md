## Key Findings

### Chapter 3 Conclusions (No-Obstacle Case)
- Sound produced when obstacle is present is well-modeled by measurements of sound produced by obstacle in free space combined with linear plane-wave model of tube system
- Source-tract interaction was observed: presence of obstacle increased low-frequency sound amplitude
- No-obstacle case was not explicitly source-modeled due to extremely low level of sound generated
- Inverse filtering revealed source-tract interaction more than for obstacle case
- A source model should NOT include pressure sources; it should be distributed
- Real fricatives likely involve constrictions and obstacles that are spatially less distinct than mechanical models used

### Chapter 4: Speech Analysis Results

#### Recording Method
- Five speakers recorded six sustained fricatives: /phi/, /theta/, /f/, /s/, /sh/, /x/ at normal and intense levels
- Speakers: CS, PP, EM (female); KS, G (male); one from India, one from Canada, rest from various US regions
- Recordings analyzed via HP 3582A spectrum analyzer: eight 25-ms windows averaged, 0-10 kHz range
- Phonation for 5+ seconds to get crude allpole vocal tract transfer function estimate

#### Spectral Parameters Introduced
- **A_T** = Total dynamic range = dB between minimum and maximum amplitude of entire spectrum
- **A_0** = Low-frequency dynamic range = dB between low-frequency amplitude and maximum amplitude of entire spectrum

#### Key Speech Measurement Results

**By Fricative:**

- **/phi/** (bilabial): Long narrow slit constriction, broad peak at low frequencies (~2 kHz), sharp decrease below peak. Overall SPL ~44/52 dB for normal/intense. A_T ~24 dB, A_0 ~12 dB mean.

- **/f/** (labiodental): Similar to /phi/, two broad peaks with trough between at low frequencies. Overall amplitude low relative to other fricatives. Mean A_T ~21.5 dB, A_0 ~12.0 dB.

- **/theta/** (dental): Two broad peaks with significant dips at ~4 kHz. Lowest A_0 value (7.1 dB mean). Second lowest energy overall. Mean A_T ~22.4 dB.

- **/s/** (alveolar): Smoothly rising spectrum, broad peak at 7 kHz. High amplitude, mean A_T ~20.0 dB, A_0 ~18.8 dB (highest).

- **/sh/** (postalveolar): Highest overall amplitude of all fricatives (mean A_S ~67.9 dB for normal, 72.4 dB intense). Trough at ~2 kHz, peaks clustered around 2-5 kHz, then around 8 kHz. Mean A_T ~33.4 dB, A_0 ~28.2 dB.

- **/x/** (velar): Single high-amplitude broad peak centered around 3 kHz, pronounced dip at 6 kHz. Mean A_T ~36.9 dB, A_0 ~18.0 dB.

**Fricative Groupings by Amplitude:**
- Low-amplitude group: /phi/, /f/, /theta/ - mean levels 10-15 dB below others
- High-amplitude group: /s/, /sh/, /x/ - absolute levels similar to obstacle cases of Ch. 3

**Key Statistical Findings (Table 4.1, p. 135):**
- Obstacle case with l_f = 3 cm: A_T mean 46.8 dB, A_0 mean 27.5 dB
- Obstacle case with l_f = 12 cm: A_T mean 43.8 dB, A_0 mean 18.0 dB
- No-obstacle l_f = 3 cm: A_T mean 26.0 dB, A_0 mean 11.0 dB
- No-obstacle l_f = 12 cm: A_T mean 21.7 dB, A_0 mean 4.5 dB

Hypothesis tests showed both A_T and A_0 significantly higher (p < .01) for obstacle case vs no-obstacle.

### Section 4.2: Speech-like Mechanical Models

#### Key Findings on Fricative Classes:

**Obstacle-generated (/s/, /sh/):**
- /s/ modeled by two-tube model: back tube, shorter front tube (2.5 cm), pressure source at mouth
- Predicted transfer function: free zero at ~3500 Hz, free pole at ~6500 Hz, bound pole-zero pairs
- For l_f = 1.5 cm, quarter-wavelength resonances at f = nc/4l_e = 3.3, 10, 17... kHz (where l_e = l_f + 8r/3*pi)
- Adding obstacle (teeth) always increases amplitude and introduces low-frequency minimum
- Both obstacle and no-obstacle cases show free zero above 10 kHz when l_o = 0.5 cm

**Surface-generated short front cavity (/phi/, /f/, /theta/):**
- Modeled by positioning constriction at mouth of 17-cm tube
- Circular constriction at 1.0 cm produces nearly flat spectrum at too low a level
- Flat-topped plug (FTP) configuration closest to /f/ speech
- For /theta/-like spectra, double rectangular slot should model (tongue shape)
- Table 4.5 shows: Circle+Obst A_S=58.3 dB, FTP A_S=60.4 dB, 2 Rectangles (/theta/-like) A_S=49.4 dB

**Surface-generated long front cavity (/gamma/, /x/):**
- /x/ produced by pulling tongue against velum/soft palate (8 cm front cavity)
- /gamma/ produced with tongue more forward, reducing front cavity length and volume
- Modeled with centered circular constriction and flat-topped plug
- For l_f = 4 cm, flat-topped plug spectrum 15 dB higher than centered circular at first resonance
- For l_f = 6 cm, resonances same for both, amplitude difference 20 dB at first resonance

## Equations Found

### Quarter-wavelength resonance for front cavity:
$$
f = \frac{nc}{4l_e} \quad \text{where } n = 1, 3, 5, \ldots
$$
Where: l_e = effective length including end correction, c = speed of sound

### Effective length with end correction:
$$
l_e = l_f + \frac{8r}{3\pi}
$$
Where: l_f = physical front cavity length, r = radius of opening

### Pressure exponent relationship:
Sound pressure varies with flow velocity as:
$$
p \propto U^n
$$
Where: n = pressure exponent (typically 4-5 for quadrupole sources, higher at low frequencies for dipole)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "In this chapter we have modeled the sound-production mechanisms for two basic configurations, a constriction in a duct with and without a downstream obstacle. The radiated spectrum produced when the obstacle is present is well-modeled by measurements of sound produced by the obstacle in free space used together with a linear plane-wave model of the tube system." (p. 123)

> "The mechanical models used are simplified, idealized representations of configurations actually occurring in speech. In particular, real fricatives are likely to involve constrictions and obstacles which are spatially less distinct, that is, more distributed, than used in the models." (p. 123)

> "In terms of overall sound pressure level, the fricatives clustered into two groups. The low-amplitude group, consisting of /phi/, f, /theta/, had mean levels that were 10 to 15 dB below those of the high-amplitude group, consisting of /s/, /sh/, x/." (p. 141)

> "The intense version of each fricative was always accompanied by a higher amplitude than the normal version, though that difference was not always evenly distributed across all frequencies." (p. 141)

> "For /s/-like do, in fact, produce spectra whose parameters fall within the first standard deviations of the parameter values measured for speech." (p. 151)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Fricative Implementation:

1. **Fricative Classification by Source Type:**
   - Obstacle-generated (teeth as obstacle): /s/, /sh/ - use AF (frication amplitude) with higher values
   - Surface-generated short cavity: /phi/, /f/, /theta/ - lower AF values, different spectral tilt
   - Surface-generated long cavity: /x/, /gamma/ - intermediate AF, distinctive spectral shape

2. **Spectral Shape Characteristics:**
   - /s/: Rising spectrum to ~7 kHz peak, high A_0 (strong low-frequency component relative to peak)
   - /sh/: Peak cluster 2-5 kHz, trough around 2 kHz, highest overall amplitude
   - /f/, /phi/: Broad low peaks, very low overall amplitude (10-15 dB below sibilants)
   - /theta/: Similar to /f/ but with distinctive dip at 4 kHz
   - /x/: Single broad peak ~3 kHz, dip at 6 kHz

3. **Dynamic Range Parameters for Synthesis:**
   - A_T values can guide overall spectral tilt settings
   - A_0 values indicate low-frequency energy presence
   - Sibilants (/s/, /sh/) have higher A_0 indicating more low-frequency content
   - Non-sibilants (/f/, /theta/, /phi/) have lower A_0

4. **Front Cavity Resonance Effects:**
   - For /s/: l_f ~ 1-2.5 cm, first resonance ~3.5 kHz
   - For /sh/: l_f ~ 2-3 cm, first resonance lower
   - For /x/: l_f ~ 4-8 cm, first resonance ~2-3 kHz
   - Resonance frequency: f = c/(4 * l_effective)

5. **Intensity Scaling:**
   - Normal to intense production increases amplitude without drastically changing spectral shape for most fricatives
   - Some formant structure shifts upward for sibilants at higher intensities

6. **Key Insight for Synthesis:**
   - The obstacle (teeth) is what makes /s/ and /sh/ high-amplitude - these are fundamentally different from /f/, /theta/
   - Surface-generated fricatives (/f/, /theta/, /phi/) can be considered as distributed sources along constriction channel
   - This supports having separate amplitude controls for different fricative classes in synthesis
