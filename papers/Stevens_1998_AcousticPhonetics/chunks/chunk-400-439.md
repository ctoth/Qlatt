## Key Findings

### Palatoalveolar Fricatives /S/ (pages 400-407)
- Point of maximum constriction is a few millimeters posterior to alveolar ridge
- Tongue blade creates a relatively long and narrow channel behind the constriction
- This channel is formed between the tongue blade surface and hard palate
- For adult male vocal tract: total branch length ~8.5 cm (1.2 cm lip cavity + 2.6 cm sublingual cavity + 4.7 cm palatal channel)
- Natural frequency spacing is ~2 kHz, leading to two natural frequencies in the range up to 4 kHz
- Lowest zero at ~1000 Hz (resonance between sublingual cavity acoustic compliance and narrow channel)
- Second zero at ~3000 Hz (between the two poles)
- The transfer function Um/ps has a pole at zero frequency (simple acoustic mass of constriction and palatal channel)
- Second formant F2 for /S/ is at ~1900 Hz (somewhat higher for female, ~1800 Hz toward edge of fricative)
- F1 for palatoalveolar is a Helmholtz resonance, somewhat lower than F1 contour in figure 8.6 due to longer constriction
- Frication noise spectrum peaks at 2.5 kHz and 3.5 kHz correspond to F3 and F4

### Perceptual Requirement for /S/ Identification
- Spectrum amplitude of noise in F3 region should be at least equal to F3 peak amplitude in adjacent vowel
- If fricative noise at high frequencies exceeds adjacent vowel, listener identifies it as /theta/ not /s/

### Summary of Voiceless Fricatives (page 411)
- Produced with supraglottal constriction formed by supraglottal articulators
- Cross-sectional area of constriction is usually somewhat smaller than glottal opening
- At fricative-vowel boundary, glottis begins to close, supraglottal constriction area increases
- Turbulence noise source generated at obstacle downstream from constriction
- Source amplitude only weakly dependent on cross-sectional area of constriction (within a few dB over 50% changes)
- For labiodental fricative: no cavity in front of constriction, no major spectral peaks below 5 kHz
- For alveolar fricative: source filtered by front-cavity resonance, leading to F4/F5 range peak

### Affricates (pages 412-422)
- Stop closure followed by rapid release, leaving relatively unconstricted airway
- Rapid increase of cross-sectional area at constriction gives brief burst of turbulence noise (transient)
- Affricate has constriction formed immediately posterior to point of release, maintained for tens of ms
- Affricate sequence: initial transient at anterior closure release + tens of ms frication noise before voicing onset

**Key Temporal Parameters:**
- Initial release of closure: 1-2 ms
- Cross-sectional area continues to increase slowly over next 50-odd ms after initial release
- Duration from release to voicing onset for voiceless affricate: ~110 ms (average for five speakers: 85-160 ms)
- Initial frication phase (F1 in figure 8.30): ~10 ms following release

**Affricate Area Changes (Figure 8.27):**
- A1 (front of tongue blade): starts near 0, increases rapidly after release
- A2 (palatal channel): starts low, increases over ~120 ms
- Ag (glottal opening): follows similar trajectory as fricative release

**Acoustic Characteristics of Affricates:**
- Transient source at instant of release, 6 dB less than alveolar stop transient (section 7.4.3)
- Front cavity natural frequency ~3500 Hz (from figure 8.19 dimensions)
- Sublingual cavity side branch introduces zero in transfer function at ~4500 Hz
- Three phases in palatoalveolar affricate release:
  1. Initial brief transient with spectral peak in F4 region (comparable to F4 vowel amplitude)
  2. 20-odd ms of increasing turbulence noise (F4 region peak, negligible palatal channel coupling)
  3. 40-50 ms where palatal channel widens, F3 peak appears at ~2500 Hz (palatal channel natural frequency)

### Table 8.4: F4 Peak Spectrum Amplitude in Affricate /tS/
| Time after release    | Measured (dB) | Calculated (dB) |
|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Initial transient     | -3(7)         | +6              |
| 10 ms after release   | -5(6)         | +3              |
| 50 ms after release   | +9(4)         | +9              |

Note: Amplitudes relative to F4 peak at beginning of vowel.

### Consonants with Aspiration /h/ (pages 422-439)

**Glottal Configuration for /h/:**
- No significant supraglottal constriction above larynx
- Spread glottal configuration with abducted vocal folds
- Maximum glottal area during consonant: ~0.25 cm^2
- Membranous portion length (lm): ~1.5 cm
- Cartilaginous portion length (lc): ~0.3 cm
- Glottal cross-sectional area: Ag = lc*wv + (1/2)*lm*wv

**Glottal Area Time Course (Figure 8.34):**
- Complete movement from modal to abducted to modal: ~200 ms
- Peak airflow: ~1000 cm^3/s (at 8 cm H2O lung pressure)
- Duration of flow peak: 100-200 ms (Klatt et al., 1968)

**H1-H2 Difference for /h/ vs Vowel:**
- H1-H2 is 8-10 dB on average during modal-to-/h/ transition
- This variation extends over 40-50 ms range
- H1-H2 rarely changes by more than 15 dB without cessation of vocal fold vibration
- Maximum abduction achieved when glottal area ~0.14 cm^2 at /h/-vowel boundary (around 210 ms for female, 260 ms for male)

**Breathy Voicing Characteristics (Figure 8.35):**
- Modal: Sharp triangular glottal pulses, strong higher harmonics
- Breathy: More sinusoidal waveform, reduced higher harmonics (6 dB reduction of H2 and higher)
- For fundamental frequency 125 Hz, first harmonic H1 amplitude same for modal and breathy
- Second harmonic H2 and higher reduced by 6 dB for breathy voice

**Turbulence Noise During /h/ (pages 428-432):**
- Noise source located 1.0-2.5 cm downstream from glottis (at epiglottis or ventricular folds)
- Three dipole noise sources at distances 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 cm from glottis
- Monopole noise source at glottis
- Sources on epiglottis surface (3-5 kHz dominant) dominate at high frequencies
- Monopole source dominates below ~2 kHz
- Effective amplitude of each dipole source: 2.2 dB re 1 dyne/cm^2 in band centered at 2.5 kHz
- Overall noise level: ~28 dB re 1 dyne/cm^2 in 300-Hz band at 2500 Hz

**Noise vs Periodic Source During /h/ (Figure 8.42):**
- Above 3 kHz: noise sources can equal or exceed periodic glottal source
- Below 2 kHz: periodic glottal source dominant (at least 15 dB above noise)
- Difference curve approximately independent of vowel in /hV/ syllable

### Table 8.5: Extra Tracheal Pole Frequencies (Hz)
| Pole | Female | Male |
|------|--------|------|
| P1   | 750    | --   |
| P2   | 1650   | 1550 |
| P3   | 2350   | 2200 |

Note: Median values from Klatt and Klatt, 1990.

**Tracheal Coupling Effects:**
- Second subglottal resonance at 1400-1800 Hz has greatest effect on /h/ spectrum
- Introduces pole-zero pair with 200 Hz bandwidth
- Adds "shoulder" below F2 prominence in /h/ spectrum
- Contribution to F1 bandwidth increase: 3-4x expected modal vibration bandwidth (280 Hz vs ~70 Hz modal)

**Supraglottal Constriction Effects (Section 8.3.1.4, pages 441-442):**
- When supraglottal constriction area Ac is comparable to glottal area Ag:
  - Pressure drop appears across supraglottal constriction
  - Turbulence noise generated at supraglottal constriction
- For vowel /i/: constriction in palatal region ~0.3 cm^2 (Fant, 1960)
- Noise amplitude proportional to U^3 * A^(-2.5) for glottal and supraglottal sources

## Equations Found

### Pressure Drop Equation (page 424)
$$\Delta P = \frac{\rho U^2}{2A_g^2}$$
where Ag = glottal area

### Volume Velocity Equation (page 442)
$$U = \sqrt{\left(\frac{R}{2K}\right)^2 + \frac{P_\ell}{K}} - \frac{R}{2K}$$
where:
- R = resistance of airways between lungs and glottis (~1.5 dyne-s-cm^(-5))
- K = (rho/2)(1/Ag^2 + 1/Ac^2)
- P_l = lung pressure

### Simplified Volume Velocity (page 442)
$$U \cong \sqrt{\frac{P_\ell}{K}}\left(1 - \frac{R}{2\sqrt{KP_\ell}}\right)$$
(when pressure drop in subglottal airways is small compared to drops at Ag and Ac)

### Turbulence Noise Amplitude (page 442)
Relative amplitudes near glottis and supraglottal constriction given by:
$$U^3 A_c^{-2.5}$$ and $$U^3 A_g^{-2.5}$$
assuming equal efficiency of noise generation at both locations.

### Transfer Function at 2.5 kHz (page 431)
$$20\log|T_z(f)| = 20\log\left|\frac{A_m}{\rho c}\sin\left(\frac{1.5f}{c}\cdot 2\pi\right)\right| = -24.2 \text{ dB at 2.5 kHz}$$
where Am = cross-sectional area of vocal tract (~4 cm^2)

## Rules/Algorithms

### Identifying /S/ vs /theta/
1. Measure F3 region amplitude in fricative noise
2. Measure F3 peak amplitude in adjacent vowel
3. If fricative F3 >= vowel F3: identify as /S/
4. If fricative noise at high frequencies > vowel: identify as /theta/

### Affricate Production Sequence
1. Form complete closure at anterior end (tongue blade to alveolar ridge)
2. Shape posterior constriction during closure
3. Release anterior closure rapidly (1-2 ms)
4. Maintain posterior constriction for 40-50 ms (frication phase)
5. Gradually widen posterior constriction
6. Begin glottal vibration ~110 ms after release

### /h/ Production Model
1. During modal vowel: Ag ~ 0.04 cm^2 (average during cycle)
2. Glottis spreads beginning ~30 ms before /h/
3. Anterior portion widens less than posterior portion
4. Maximum Ag ~ 0.25 cm^2 at peak abduction
5. Peak airflow ~1000 cm^3/s at 8 cm H2O lung pressure
6. Return to modal configuration over ~100 ms

### Aspiration Noise Calculation for /h/
1. Determine glottal opening Ag (from figure 8.34)
2. Calculate airflow U from pressure drop equation
3. Estimate noise source level from 20 log U^3 * A^(-2.5)
4. Add radiation characteristic (+74 dB for 20 cm distance)
5. Apply vocal tract transfer function
6. Adjust for tracheal coupling if F2 near 1400-1800 Hz

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The observation that the spectrum amplitude of the frication noise for /s/ is significantly higher than the spectrum of the vowel in the frequency region of the fifth formant is in accord with the results of perceptual experiments with synthetic fricative-vowel syllables (K. N. Stevens, 1985)." (p. 400)

> "Voiceless fricative consonants are produced with a narrowing of a supraglottal constriction that is formed by one of the supraglottal articulators. The cross-sectional area of this constriction is usually somewhat smaller than the area of the glottal opening, which is widened to form this type of fricative." (p. 411)

> "A contrasting class of stop consonants is the affricate. An affricate is produced by shaping and positioning the articulatory structure in such a way that the rapid release is produced at the anterior end of the constriction formed by the articulator." (p. 412)

> "The amplitude of this source is only weakly dependent (within a few decibels) on the cross-sectional area of the constriction or of the glottal opening over changes of 50-odd percent in these areas." (p. 411)

> "Turbulence noise generated at the walls is expected to be the dominant source of noise in the vocal tract, assuming that the supraglottal airway is not constricted in the pharyngeal or oral regions." (p. 428)

> "The pole-zero pair that has the greatest effect on the spectrum for /h/ and for breathy voicing is often the one in the vicinity of the second subglottal resonance, which is in the range of 1400 to 1800 Hz for an adult." (p. 437)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer - Fricative /S/
1. **Source location**: Position turbulence source posterior to alveolar ridge
2. **Front cavity**: Model as two tubes (sublingual + palatal channel) with total length ~8.5 cm for male
3. **Zeros**: Implement zeros at ~1000 Hz and ~3000 Hz from sublingual cavity coupling
4. **F2 target**: ~1900 Hz for male, scale up ~20% for female
5. **F3/F4 prominences**: Primary energy peaks at 2500 Hz and 3250 Hz

### For Klatt Synthesizer - Affricates
1. **Transient burst**:
   - Duration: 1-2 ms
   - Spectral peak: F4 region (~3500 Hz)
   - Amplitude: 6 dB less than alveolar stop burst
2. **Frication phase**:
   - Duration: 40-50 ms before voicing onset
   - Total release-to-voicing: ~110 ms (range 85-160 ms)
   - Early phase (0-10 ms): F4 peak dominant
   - Late phase (10-50 ms): F3 peak emerges at ~2500 Hz
3. **Cross-sectional area trajectory**: Follow figure 8.27 curves for A1, A2, Ag

### For Klatt Synthesizer - Aspiration /h/
1. **AH parameter timing**:
   - Ramp up over ~100 ms before /h/
   - Peak duration: 100-200 ms
   - Ramp down over ~100 ms returning to vowel
2. **Spectral balance**:
   - Below 2 kHz: periodic source dominates (reduce AH)
   - Above 3 kHz: aspiration noise can dominate
   - Use figure 8.42 difference curve as guide
3. **H1-H2 control (OQ parameter)**:
   - Increase OQ during /h/ to reduce H2 by ~6 dB
   - Transition time: 40-50 ms
4. **Bandwidth adjustment**:
   - Increase B1 during /h/ by 3-4x (280 Hz vs ~70 Hz modal)
5. **Tracheal coupling** (optional for realism):
   - Add pole-zero pair near 1400-1800 Hz
   - Spacing ~200 Hz
   - Most prominent when F2 is near this range

### Formant Transition Guidance
- /S/-vowel boundary: F1 fall is rapid, F2 transition depends on vowel context
- /tS/-vowel boundary: F1 at ~200 Hz during frication, rapid rise to vowel target
- /h/-vowel boundary: Formants should be at vowel targets throughout (no constriction effect)
