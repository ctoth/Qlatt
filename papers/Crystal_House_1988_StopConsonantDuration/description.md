Crystal and House (1988) measure the durations of English stop consonants (hold and release portions) in connected speech, showing that laboratory-derived generalizations about voicing and place effects often do not apply to natural discourse. Key findings include that hold portions do not reliably distinguish voicing in connected speech (both ~53 ms), while release durations clearly differentiate voicing (voiced ~18 ms vs voiceless ~39 ms) and place of articulation (velars ~44 ms, alveolars ~30 ms, labials ~20 ms), and that only 59% of stops in connected speech are "complete" with both hold and release segments. This empirical data is essential for TTS systems because it reveals that duration rules must account for natural speech patterns: shortened holds, context-dependent release durations, probabilistic completeness of stops especially word-finally, and shorter releases in consonant clusters.
