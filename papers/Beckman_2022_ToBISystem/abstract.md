# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

*Note: This is a handbook chapter without a formal abstract. The following is extracted from the introductory section (pp. 151-152).*

This chapter introduces what the ToBI conventions are and how the ToBI transcription system works and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the ToBI system. It also describes some of the recent developments in the prosodic transcription system that attempt to address the ToBI system's known limitations. Before introducing how the ToBI system works, section 4.2 offers a brief description of the theoretical background and framework on which ToBI is based. Section 4.3 presents the ToBI conventions and how the ToBI system has been applied to typologically various languages, showing the workings of the phonological theory it has adopted. Section 4.4 presents the strengths of the ToBI system; section 4.5 discusses the problems and challenges ToBI users face, as well as recent developments that have been made in response to such challenges; and section 4.6 concludes the chapter.

ToBI, which stands for tones and break indices, is the most well-known annotation system for prosody at the level of phonology. It aims to transcribe the phonological properties of intonation (the "tones" part) and the perceived degree of juncture between words (the "break indices" part), which together represent the prominence patterns and prosodic structure of an utterance. Thus, the tone labels used in the ToBI system of a specific language are meant to represent underlying tonal targets that are both meaningful to native speakers of the language and systematic and consistent across native speakers of the language variety.

## Our Interpretation

This handbook chapter provides a comprehensive specification of the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) prosodic annotation system, which uses the Autosegmental-Metrical framework to mark pitch accents (H*, L*, L+H*, etc.), boundary tones, and juncture strength (break indices 0-4) in speech. The chapter explains the theoretical foundations, presents annotation conventions for Mainstream American English (MAE_ToBI) and other languages, discusses strengths and limitations of the system, and introduces the AM+ extension with five pitch levels. For speech synthesis, ToBI provides the essential phonological framework for generating F0 contours and phrase boundaries from abstract prosodic representations.
