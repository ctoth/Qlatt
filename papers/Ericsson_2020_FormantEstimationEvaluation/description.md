This paper evaluates the optimized formant ceiling procedure (Escudero et al., 2009) against fixed generic ceilings using 2250 synthetic Swedish vowels with known formant frequencies, systematically testing performance across F0 levels from 100 to 500 Hz. The key finding is that the optimized ceiling method does not outperform the simpler generic ceiling approach, and both methods fail significantly when fundamental frequency exceeds the first formant frequency, particularly affecting close vowels like [i] and [u]. For speech synthesis, this work validates that standard Praat settings (5000 Hz male / 5500 Hz female ceilings) are adequate, while highlighting the fundamental challenge that formant estimation becomes unreliable when F0 > F1, which is unavoidable regardless of methodology.
