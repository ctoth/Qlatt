# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Recent work on speech synthesis by rule has led to the design and evaluation of a new digital formant synthesizer. The synthesizer was simulated on a digital computer at a 20-kHz sampling frequency. The improvements over previous synthesizers include: an excitation source for the unvoiced component of voiced fricatives; a method for producing a voice bar for the closure period of voiced stops; and a simple design for the higher pole correction network that exploits the properties of sampled data systems. Spectrographic examples of synthetic speech are shown in order to illustrate these improvements. A brief discussion of some advantages and disadvantages of serial and parallel synthesizers is presented.

## Our Interpretation

This paper presents a novel digital implementation of a terminal-analog speech synthesizer running at 20 kHz, introducing three key improvements: a pitch-synchronous modulation technique for the unvoiced component of voiced fricatives, a voice bar generation method for stop consonant closure periods, and an elegant higher-pole correction network that leverages sampled data system properties. The work demonstrates the practical advantages of digital formant synthesis by rule and provides detailed architectural comparisons between serial and parallel topologies, establishing design principles that would influence formant synthesizer development for decades.
