# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Recent advances in physiological data collection methods have made it possible to test the accuracy of predictions against speaker-specific vocal tracts and acoustic patterns. Vocal tract dimensions for /ɹ/ derived via magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) for two speakers of American English were used to construct models of the acoustics of /ɹ/. Because previous models have not sufficiently accounted for the very low F3 characteristic of /ɹ/, the aim was to match formant frequencies predicted by the models to the full range of formant frequency values produced by the speakers in recordings of real words containing /ɹ/. In one set of experiments, area functions derived from MRI data were used to argue that the Perturbation Theory of tube acoustics cannot adequately account for /ɹ/, primarily because predicted locations did not match speakers' actual constriction locations. Different models of the acoustics of /ɹ/ were tested using the Maeda computer simulation program; the supralingual vocal-tract dimensions reported in Alwan et al. were found to be adequate at predicting only the highest of attested F3 values. By using (1) a recently developed adaptation of the Maeda model that incorporates the sublingual space as a side branch from the front cavity, and by including (2) the sublingual space as an increment to the dimensions of the front cavity, the mid-to-low values of the speakers' F3 range were matched. Finally, a simple tube model with dimensions derived from MRI data was developed to account for cavity affiliations. This confirmed F3 as a front cavity resonance, and variations in F1, F2, and F4 as arising from mid- and back-cavity geometries. Possible trading relations for F3 lowering based on different acoustic mechanisms for extending the front cavity are also proposed.

## Our Interpretation

This paper uses MRI-derived vocal tract measurements to model the acoustic properties of American English /ɹ/, addressing the central challenge of explaining its characteristically low F3 formant frequency. The key finding is that the sublingual (below-tongue) cavity must be included in acoustic models to account for the full range of F3 values speakers produce, and that F3 is fundamentally a front cavity resonance rather than the result of distributed constrictions predicted by earlier perturbation theory. This work is directly relevant to formant synthesis because it provides anatomically grounded cavity affiliations and tube dimensions that can be used to derive realistic formant frequencies for /ɹ/ production across different articulatory configurations (retroflex vs bunched tongue positions).
