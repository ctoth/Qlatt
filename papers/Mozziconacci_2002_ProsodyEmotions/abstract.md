# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The investigation of emotional speech constitutes quite a multidisciplinary research field. In order to benefit from the mutual enrichment that might result from this interdisciplinarity, it seems important to clarify what the specific contribution of a particular field can be. In this paper, an attempt is made to shed light on the type of contribution proposed by the tradition of studies of prosody to studies of expression of emotion in speech. Methodological issues that might contribute to the fruitfulness of studies of expressive speech are discussed.

## Our Interpretation

This paper examines how prosody contributes to emotional expression in speech, bridging prosody research with emotion studies through a methodological framework. Mozziconacci investigates which prosodic parameters (particularly intonation/F0 contour, pitch level, pitch range) carry emotional information and shows these can be modeled and controlled for speech synthesis. The work is directly relevant to expressive TTS systems, providing evidence that systematic prosodic variation significantly enhances the naturalness and emotional authenticity of synthetic speech.
