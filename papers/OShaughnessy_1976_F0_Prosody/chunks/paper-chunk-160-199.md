## Key Findings

### Paragraph F0 Lowering Effect

F0 is generally lower in paragraph utterances (PUs) than in identical sentences spoken in isolation (citation utterances - CUs). Key observations:
- Both accent rises and F0 peaks attained in paragraphs were a few Hz less on average
- F0 peaks in later sentences are rarely as high as that of the first sentence (Lea, 1973:29)
- Initial value of F0 in a later clause "may be somewhat lower than at the beginning of the utterance" (Mattingly, 1968:171)
- In short paragraphs (2-4 sentences), F0 levels decrease with each sentence
- Last sentence: -13 Hz relative to CU
- Next to last: -3 Hz
- Second from last: -5 Hz
- First sentence: no change

### New/Old Information and F0 Accent

The fundamental principle: **Words least predictable in context receive the heaviest accents.**

In paragraph and Q/A environments:
- Repeat occurrences of words (providing old information) get decreased accent
- Remaining new words increase in accent (via decreased competition and increased separation)
- Simple anaphoric repetition was NOT sufficient for decreased accent
- When repeated word was from a set of mentioned words, it retained accent to help distinguish it from others in the set
- References to supersets of previously-mentioned items had little accent
- Subsets (which further specify items) retained accent
- Lexically-repeated words not involving actual anaphoric relations lost less accent than true old information words

### Parallel Structure Effects on F0

Sentences with co-ordinated elements exhibit parallelism in conjoined units:
- Successive phrases frequently have similar syntactic structures
- Words in parallel positions observe IC relationship
- To highlight inherent contrast, elements in parallel usually receive larger F0 accents than other content words
- Example: "The large bears are white, and the small bears are yellowish" - comparisons made between "large/small" and "white/yellow"

Parallel items get heavier accent (Lea et al, 1975:35). Halliday uses a "system" of "Co-ordination Contrast" in intonation description (1967:35).

### Consecutive Word Repetition for Emphasis

When a word is repeated twice in succession for emphasis (e.g., "Joe will never, never eat fish again"):
- First occurrence was heavily increased in accent (+25 more, +15 higher peak)
- JA (but not KS or DO) increased accent on the second "never" by having a -33 greater descent there than on "actually"

### Prepositional Phrase (PP) Accent Patterns

Agentive vs. Manner PPs in passive sentences:
- Manner PPs tended to get more accent than agentive PPs when agent did not name a specific person
- When manner PP was an idiomatic expression, distribution was less clear
- More predictable the PP object was (given prior context), less accent it received
- Specific names cannot be anticipated in citation utterances, but idioms often can

### Focus Transformations and F0

Four types of focus transformations identified:
1. **Clefting**: Removes constituent, places it in "It+be..." phrase at start (e.g., "It was a farmer who was eating the carrot")
2. **Pseudo-clefting**: Appends "what" to rest of sentence, connects with "be" (e.g., "What a farmer was eating was the carrot")
3. **Dummy-insertion**: Removes NP, leaves relative pronoun, appends dummy word ("one," "thing"), connects with "be" (e.g., "A farmer was the one who was eating the carrot")
4. **There-insertion**: Transforms verb group into "be"-form, places "There" in front (e.g., "There was a farmer eating the carrot")

Scale of transformations with decreasing 'focus' effects:
- Clefting (strongest)
- There-insertion
- This-insertion
- Dummy-insertion (weakest)

### F0 Effects of Focus Transformations

For the sentence "A farmer was eating the carrot" with focus on "farmer":
- Untransformed: "farmer" (158 peak, -24 descent), "eating" (+23 accent, 125 peak), "carrot" (+18 accent, 126 peak)
- Clefted/there-inserted: Small accent decrease on unfocused words ("eating" and "carrot" had peaks -17 and -11 lower)
- The major effect: focused word ("farmer") had all high peaks with large F0 descents
- Transformed cases #2-3 had descents of -55 and -50 (vs. -24 in untransformed)

### Passive Transformation Effects

In passive transformation ("A farmer ate the carrot" -> "The carrot was eaten by a farmer"):
- Original object placed in initial, subject position
- Original subject placed in final, prepositional phrase
- Consistent effect across speakers: decreased accent peaks (-11 less) on nouns in passive case vs. active case
- Passive may de-emphasize surface subject in favor of verb

### Preposing Effects

Adverb preposing ("Never has Nicky eaten fish") and VP preposing ("Cooking the fish will be the master chef"):
- Preposed phrase switches positions with subject
- Presence of preposing had modest F0 effect on first clause
- Preposed words ("buy," "juice") increased in relative accent as part of preposing emphasis
- Peaks averaged +7 higher in preposed versions across 3 speakers

| Passive accent decrease | - | -11 | Hz | Less accent on nouns in passive |
| Preposing peak increase | - | +7 | Hz | Higher peaks in preposed versions |

## Rules/Algorithms

### Rule 1: Paragraph F0 Lowering
```
For each sentence S in paragraph P:
  sentence_position = index of S in P (1-based)
  if sentence_position == 1:
    F0_adjustment = 0
  else:
    F0_adjustment = -3 to -13 Hz (increasing with position from end)
  Apply F0_adjustment to all peaks in S
```

### Rule 2: New/Old Information Accent Assignment
```
For each content word W in utterance:
  if W is first occurrence in discourse:
    accent_type = "new"
    accent_level = base_accent + information_load_bonus
  else if W is repeated from earlier in paragraph:
    if W is from a set requiring disambiguation:
      accent_level = base_accent (retain for distinction)
    else:
      accent_level = base_accent - old_information_penalty

  # Competition/separation effect:
  nearby_new_words = count new words near W
  if nearby_new_words is low:
    accent_level += separation_bonus
```

### Rule 3: Parallel Structure Accent Boost
```
For sentence with parallel elements (P1, P2, ...):
  for each parallel pair (Pi, Pj):
    # Items in parallel positions get boosted accent
    Pi.accent += parallel_boost  # typically +20-30 Hz peak
    Pj.accent += parallel_boost

    # "Focus" element (often last item) gets extra emphasis
    if is_focus_element:
      add_optional_focus_word("was") to enhance parallel structure
```

### Rule 4: Focus Transformation F0 Assignment
```
For focus transformation with focused_word:
  # Focused word characteristics:
  focused_word.peak = HIGH (typically 150-170 Hz)
  focused_word.descent = LARGE (-40 to -60 Hz)

  # Unfocused words lose accent:
  for other_word in content_words:
    other_word.peak -= 10 to 20 Hz
    other_word.accent -= 5 to 15 units

  # Scale of focus strength:
  focus_strength = {
    "clefting": 1.0,
    "there-insertion": 0.9,
    "this-insertion": 0.8,
    "dummy-insertion": 0.7,
    "pseudo-clefting": 0.6  # double-focussing effect
  }
```

### Rule 5: Emphatic Word Repetition
```
For word W repeated consecutively for emphasis (W W):
  W1.accent += 25  # First occurrence heavily boosted
  W1.peak += 15

  # Second occurrence varies by speaker:
  if speaker_style == "contrastive":
    W2.descent += 33  # Larger fall than surrounding words
  else:
    W2.accent = W1.accent  # Similar to first
```

> "Cleft sentences involve emphatic rather than normal stress" (Akmajian, 1973:219) (page 200)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody System:

1. **Discourse Tracking**: Implement a discourse model that tracks:
   - Words already mentioned (for old/new distinction)
   - Sentence position within paragraph
   - Semantic sets (for disambiguation requirements)

2. **Paragraph Position F0 Scaling**:
   ```javascript
   function getParagraphF0Adjustment(sentenceIndex, totalSentences) {
     if (sentenceIndex === 0) return 0;
     // Later sentences get progressively lower F0
     const positionFromEnd = totalSentences - sentenceIndex;
     if (positionFromEnd === 1) return -13;  // Last sentence
     if (positionFromEnd === 2) return -5;   // Second to last
     if (positionFromEnd === 3) return -3;   // Third to last
     return -1;  // Earlier sentences
   }
   ```

3. **Information Status Classification**:
   - Track first mention vs. subsequent mentions
   - Reduce accent on repeated words by 6-14 Hz
   - Exception: words needing disambiguation retain accent

4. **Parallel Structure Detection**:
   - Detect coordinated structures (and, but, or)
   - Identify parallel positions (Adj-N and Adj-N)
   - Boost accent on parallel items (+20-30 Hz peaks)

5. **Focus Transformation Handling**:
   - Detect cleft constructions ("It was X who/that...")
   - Apply large descent (-50 Hz) after focused element
   - Reduce accent on post-focus content words

6. **Preposing Detection**:
   - Identify fronted adverbs/VPs
   - Boost accent on preposed elements (+7 Hz peak)

### Key Insight for Implementation:
The central principle is **predictability from context**. More predictable = less accent. This requires:
- Discourse history tracking
- Semantic relationship modeling
- Syntactic transformation detection

A simplified heuristic: First mention of content words gets full accent; subsequent mentions get reduced accent unless disambiguation is needed.
