This paper presents a robust method for fitting Liljencrants-Fant glottal source model parameters to speech using iterative adaptive inverse filtering, two-stage gradient descent optimization, and CART-based refinement. The key contribution is the combined use of LF model fitting with 4th-order LPC residual modeling to capture both the periodic glottal pulse and high-frequency components without requiring explicit voicing decisions. This work provides practical algorithms for LF parameter extraction and introduces F0-independent quotient representations (OQ, SQ, RQ) that could simplify parameter scheduling in formant synthesizers like Qlatt.
