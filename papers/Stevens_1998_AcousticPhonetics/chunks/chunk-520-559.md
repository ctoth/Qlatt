## Key Findings

### Glides /w/ and /j/

- **Labial glide /w/**: Characterized by low F1 (relatively), suppressed F2 peak, weak spectrum amplitude at high frequencies due to lowered F1 and F2
- F1 spectral peak for glide is about 5 dB lower than for vowel
- F2 prominence is at least 30 dB lower in level than F1 peak, obscured by upward spread of masking from F1
- F3 peak corresponding to the glide is more than 30 dB below that in the adjacent vowel
- During labial glide in intervocalic position: F1 and F2 move downward into the glide and upward following release
- Duration of formant movements from minimum constriction point for glide into vowel is 100 ms or more

### Palatal Glide /j/

- Second-formant frequency that is high and close to F3 and F4
- For palatal glide with back and front cavity lengths of l_b = 10 cm and l_f = 6 cm:
  - F2 = c/2l_b = 1770 Hz
  - F3 = c/2l_f = 2950 Hz
  - F4 = c/l_b = 3540 Hz
- F3 bandwidth is relatively large due to radiation losses and losses at the palatal constriction
- Energy concentration in frequency range of 3-4 kHz dominated by F4 peak at 3.5 kHz
- F3 not manifested as separate spectral prominence but rather as a shoulder on low-frequency side of F4 peak
- During motion from /a/ to palatal glide: F2 increases and F3 decreases initially, then F3 increases again

### Liquids /r/ and /l/

**General Characteristics:**
- Constriction is NOT sufficiently narrow to cause significant pressure drop or turbulence noise
- Constriction formed with tongue blade or tongue body with rounded lips (for glides)
- Airway between glottis and lips cannot be approximated as simple tube - tongue creates split/bifurcation
- First-formant frequency is slightly higher than for glides (about 400 Hz)
- Lowest natural frequency of resonator for liquid is about 400 Hz (slightly higher than high vowel F1)
- **F1 for liquids in prestressed position**: Female speakers 350-480 Hz, Male speakers 330-430 Hz
- Constriction cross-sectional area should be no less than 0.17 cm^2

**F1 Characteristics for Liquids:**
- Increased bandwidth of about 80 Hz over expected 60 Hz due to other sources of loss
- Expected amplitude of F1 spectral peak for liquid will be at least 7 dB below that for following vowel (about 2 dB due to lowered frequency, 5 dB due to increased bandwidth)
- Change in amplitude of F1 peak from glide to vowel is less than 10 dB
- F1 prominence about 10 dB below level of F1 in vowel (measured 50 ms after consonant release)

### Retroflex /r/

- Produced with tongue blade raised, tongue tip lowered (bunched) OR raised tongue blade with space under tongue
- Front-cavity resonance F_R close to F2 - causes pole-zero interaction
- **Characteristic acoustic pattern**: pair of spectral peaks in F2 range (1.5-2.5 kHz)
- Back cavity length ~13.5 cm, front cavity ~8 cm^3
- Helmholtz resonance about 380 Hz (accounts for F1)
- F2 close to back-cavity resonance around 1310 Hz
- F3 = 2800 Hz and 3900 Hz (higher-frequency modes of back cavity)
- Additional resonance F_R at frequency of front-cavity (1500-2000 Hz) with pole-zero pair
- Zero at 3 kHz range, pole at F_R around 2500 Hz
- Spectral prominence at about 1300 Hz with "shoulder" on high-frequency side
- During release: F_R and Z_R merge, pole and zero annihilate at ~2500 Hz within tens of milliseconds
- Spectrum amplitude increase of 10-20 dB over 40 ms at release

**Measured Formant Frequencies for /r/ (Table 9.2):**
| Speaker | F1 | F2 | F_R |
|---------|-----|------|------|
| Female | 360-480 Hz | 1030-1240 Hz | 1800-2050 Hz |
| Male | 330-430 Hz | 880-1200 Hz | 1380-1610 Hz |

### Lateral /l/

- Tongue blade in contact with alveolar ridge at midline
- Lateral edges NOT in contact - forms acoustic side branch
- Side branch length estimated about 2.5 cm, volume about 2-3 cm^3
- Creates additional pole-zero pair in transfer function (above 1500 Hz)
- **Cluster of three poles and one zero** in high-frequency range (2500-4000 Hz)
- Zero at frequency of 3500-4000 Hz (where impedance into side branch becomes zero)

**Lateral Configuration Calculated Spectrum (Figure 9.44):**
- Poles (and bandwidths) in Hz: 360 (160), 1100 (140), 2800 (150), 3500 (300), 3900 (1000), 4500
- Zero at 3400 Hz (300 bandwidth)
- Results in broad irregular high-frequency spectral prominence

**Measured Formant Frequencies for /l/ (Table 9.3):**
| Position | Speaker | F1 (Hz) | F2 (Hz) | Delta-F1 (Hz) | Delta-F2 (Hz) | Delta-A1 (dB) | Delta-A2 (dB) | Delta-A3 (dB) |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Prestressed | Female | 350 (67) | 1180 (84) | 190 (66) | 280 (190) | 6 (3.1) | 13 (2.6) | 14 (4.0) |
| Prestressed | Male | 360 (43) | 900 (120) | 150 (42) | 220 (113) | 9 (2.2) | 13 (2.4) | 12 (4.8) |
| Poststressed | Female | - | - | 20 (75) | 100 (75) | 2 (1.5) | 5 (2.0) | 3 (3.3) |
| Poststressed | Male | - | - | 60 (53) | 150 (91) | 1 (1.4) | 5 (3.0) | 3 (3.2) |

### Summary of Liquid Characteristics (Section 9.3.3)

- Liquids /r/ and /l/ produced by raising tongue blade to form narrowing in region of hard palate
- Like glides: produced with little or no pressure drop, continuous glottal vibration
- Spectrum amplitude may decrease slightly due to constriction influence on glottal source
- F1 for liquids is higher than for glides
- Lowest spectral prominence generally lower than following vowels (greater F1 bandwidth + reduced glottal source amplitude)
- Second formant for both liquids: primarily resonance of cavity posterior to main constriction (900-1200 Hz)
- Acoustic path for liquids contains side branch(es) - additional poles and zeros in mid/high frequencies
- In intervocalic position: acoustic influence extends 200-250 ms
- Liquids similar to glides in this respect

**Key Differences Between /r/ and /l/:**
- Retroflex /r/: Space under raised tongue blade gives additional resonance F_R (1500-2000 Hz) + zero depressing spectrum above this
- Lateral /l/: Complete midline closure, side branch to lips creates cluster of three poles and zero forming broad high-frequency prominence

### Chapter 10: Context Effects

**Consonant Sequences at Syllable Onset:**
- When consonant is in CV syllable, cues for consonant features reside in sound near instant of release
- When sequence of two consonants at beginning/end of syllable, features may have different form
- Initial /s/ in cluster: modifications expected due to context

**Fricative + Stop Clusters (e.g., /sp/, /sk/):**
- During /sp/: glottis relatively open, tongue blade forms constriction
- Front-cavity resonance about 5.9 kHz (for short front cavity ~1.5 cm)
- When lips close for labial stop: front-cavity frequency decreases
- Rate of decrease of lip area: about 50 cm^2/s (lips close in ~20 ms)
- Cross-sectional area of tongue blade constriction: 0.1-0.2 cm^2, length ~0.5 cm
- Helmholtz resonance of front cavity: 2.5-3.5 kHz for female speaker
- Front-cavity resonance calculated to decrease rapidly as lip area becomes smaller

**Stop + Liquid Clusters (e.g., /dr/, /pl/):**
- Interval of about 50 ms from stop consonant release to onset of glottal vibration (for /dr/)
- For voiced stop followed by vowel: burst duration ~10 ms
- For /dr/ sequence: /r/ constriction cross-sectional area ~0.17 cm^2, maintained for 50+ ms after release
- Airflow through constriction comes from recoil of vocal tract walls and flow through glottis
- Pressure drop at constriction sufficient to maintain intraoral pressure during initial 50-odd milliseconds
- Delay before transglottal pressure becomes sufficient for glottal vibration

**Timing Observations:**
- Delay from labial release to onset of glottal vibration: about 80 ms (for /pl/)
- The glottis gradually closes during voiceless stop until configuration permits vocal fold vibration
- Release transient excites resonances of vocal tract behind lips
- At about 15 ms: tongue blade makes contact with hard palate, lateral constriction in place
- High-frequency spectral peak 4-6 kHz (turbulence noise at lips)
- Reduced amplitude at lower frequencies due to zero in transfer function

**Nasal Consonant Effects (e.g., /sm/):**
- At labial closure: velopharyngeal port opens, increased pressure in oral cavity
- About 10-20 ms after labial closure: air flows through velopharyngeal port opening
- Pressure release marked by brief, weak transient in sound
- Spectrum prominences at about 600 and 2100 Hz (first two resonances of nasal cavity)
- Additional prominence at 1450 Hz (probably vocal tract resonance)
- Coupling to nasal cavity continues until shortly after release of labial consonant (~350 ms)
- Glottal opening follows trajectory similar to initial cluster /sp/

## Rules/Algorithms

### Glide-to-Vowel Formant Transitions
1. For labial glide /w/: F1 and F2 move downward into glide, upward following release
2. F2 spectral peak is prominent at time constriction is narrowest
3. Spectral amplitude of higher frequencies increases after glide release
4. Duration of transition from minimum constriction to vowel >= 100 ms

### Palatal Glide /j/ Formant Behavior
1. During motion from /a/ to /j/:
   - F2 increases (associated with back cavity becoming front-cavity resonance)
   - F3 decreases initially (as front-cavity resonance merges with F2)
   - F3 eventually increases (becomes back-cavity resonance)
2. F3 reverses direction of motion during transition into and out of glide

### Retroflex /r/ Spectral Pattern Rule
1. Look for pole-zero pair interaction creating "shoulder" around 1500-2000 Hz
2. At release: F_R and Z_R merge and annihilate at ~2500 Hz
3. Amplitude increase of 10-20 dB over 40 ms at release
4. Characteristic: two spectral peaks in F2 range (double peak around 950-1350 Hz and 2000-2300 Hz)

### Lateral /l/ Spectral Pattern Rule
1. Identify broad irregular prominence in 2500-4000 Hz range
2. Zero at ~3400 Hz suppresses pole at 3.5 kHz
3. At release: rapid rise in cluster formant peaks (F1, F2) over 10-20 ms
4. High-frequency peak (F3/F4 region) increases abruptly at release

### Voice Onset Time (VOT) Rules for Clusters
1. /dr/ cluster: ~50 ms delay from stop release to voicing onset
2. /pl/ cluster: ~80 ms delay from labial release to voicing onset
3. Simple CV voiced stop: ~10 ms burst duration
4. Constriction must be maintained for sufficient time to allow transglottal pressure buildup

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The glides /w/ and /j/ are produced with a narrowing in the oral cavity that is more constricted than for a high vowel. This configuration leads to a relatively low first-formant frequency in the range of 250 to 300 Hz."

> "The liquids /r/ and /l/ considered in this section are produced by raising the tongue blade to form a narrowing of the airway in the region of the hard palate. In common with glides, these liquids are produced with little or no pressure drop due to the glottal airflow, or to cause turbulence noise to be generated in the vicinity of the constriction."

> "A further difference between liquids and glides is that the airway between the glottis and the lips for liquids cannot be approximated as a simple tube in which one-dimensional waves propagate. Rather, the tongue in the oral cavity is shaped in such a way that there is a split or bifurcation of the airway."

> "The pattern of spectral change at the release of a lateral consonant has some similarities to the release of a nasal consonant, in that both show a relatively abrupt rise in amplitude for some spectral peaks."

> "The two examples in figure 10.1 show that the place of articulation of a stop consonant that follows /s/ in a consonant cluster can be signaled by perturbations in the noise spectrum for /s/ as the consonant closure is made."

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Implementation:

1. **Glide /w/ Synthesis:**

7. **Side Branch Modeling:**
   - Lateral /l/ requires pole-zero pair for side branch
   - Retroflex /r/ requires pole-zero pair for sublingual cavity
   - Both introduce spectral zeros that weaken mid/high frequency spectrum during constriction
