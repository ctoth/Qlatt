This paper investigates how laryngeal control—glottal aperture, tissue characteristics, and aerodynamic conditions—contributes to Voice Onset Time (VOT) variability across men, women, and 5-year-old children, challenging the assumption that VOT acquisition is purely an interarticulator timing problem. Key findings show that men predominantly produce fully voiced /h/ with high peak airflows, women show variable voicing patterns, and children exhibit twice the VOT variability of adults, with strong correlations between /h/ voicing behavior (VOTh) and stop consonant VOTs, indicating that laryngeal control is a significant developmental factor alongside articulatory timing. For speech synthesis, the work provides critical evidence that male and female voice models require different voicing strategies for aspirated stops and fricatives, and demonstrates that breathiness in fricatives like /h/ can be achieved through laryngeal adjustments independent of glottal opening extent.
