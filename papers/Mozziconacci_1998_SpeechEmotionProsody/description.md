This thesis quantifies the prosodic parameters (pitch level, pitch range, speech rate, and intonation patterns) required to synthesize seven distinct emotions in speech using Dutch speakers as the reference population. Key contributions include establishing optimal parameter values for each emotion, demonstrating that complex F0 contours can be approximated with simple rules achieving 63% emotion recognition accuracy, and identifying which intonation patterns suit each emotion while revealing that voice quality is essential for sadness and fear expression. These findings are directly applicable to the Qlatt Klatt synthesizer for implementing emotional speech variation through pitch and duration manipulation in the TTS frontend.
