This paper systematically quantifies the perceptual importance of various acoustic parameters in synthetic vowel perception through a 300-trial listening experiment with 66 stimuli. The key findings establish a clear hierarchy: formant frequencies are most perceptually salient, followed by spectral tilt and amplitude, while bandwidth changes have surprisingly minimal effect (requiring 10× larger percentage changes to match the perceptual distance of formant shifts). For Klatt-style synthesis, this provides empirical justification for prioritizing formant frequency accuracy over bandwidth precision, and highlights that random phase in harmonics creates the most dramatic quality degradation, implicating temporal neural processing in pitch perception.
