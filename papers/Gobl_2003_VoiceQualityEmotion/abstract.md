# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This paper explores the role of voice quality in the communication of emotions, moods and attitudes. Listeners reactions to an utterance synthesised with seven different voice qualities were elicited in terms of pairs of opposing affective attributes. The voice qualities included harsh voice, tense voice, modal voice, breathy voice, whispery voice, creaky voice and lax–creaky voice. These were synthesised using a formant synthesiser, and the voice source parameter settings were guided by prior analytic studies as well as auditory judgements. Results offer support for some past observations on the association of voice quality and affect, and suggest a number of refinements in some cases. Listeners ratings further suggest that these qualities are considerably more effective in signalling milder affective states than the strong emotions. It is clear that there is no one-to-one mapping between voice quality and affect: rather a given quality tends to be associated with a cluster of affective attributes.

## Our Interpretation

This paper demonstrates that voice quality alone can evoke distinct emotional and affective coloring in synthesized speech, operating somewhat independently from fundamental frequency or pitch dynamics. The key finding is that different voice qualities (tense, breathy, creaky, etc.) map to clusters of related emotional attributes rather than single emotions, with qualities being more effective at signaling subtle moods, attitudes, and speaker states than strong emotions like fear or sadness. For speech synthesis applications seeking expressive voice, this work provides empirical evidence that manipulating glottal source parameters through formant synthesis can effectively convey affective nuance.
