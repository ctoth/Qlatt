## Key Findings

### Letter-to-Sound Conversion (p. 26)
- LTS conversion = orthography to pronunciation mapping
- MITalk approach: small "exception" dictionary + letter-to-sound rules
- Exception dictionary contained "morphs" combined via morphophonological rules
- LTS rules were contextual: "orthographic *c* is phonetic /k/ unless before *i* or *e*, then /s/"
- Hundreds of ordered LTS rules required for acceptable English accuracy

### Neural Network Approaches (pp. 27-29)
- NETtalk (Sejnowski & Rosenberg 1987): Neural network trained on commercial dictionary
- Used "1 out of n" coding for orthographic input (each letter = atomic unit)
- Phonemic output encoded in *distributed* manner (phonemes as feature bundles)
- Hare (1990): Jordan network for Hungarian vowel harmony
- Rodd (1997): Elman network for Turkish vowel harmony phonotactics
- Goldsmith (1992, 1993): Harmonic phonology using network activations for stress/syllabification

### Categorical vs. Gradient Phenomena (pp. 30-35)
- Two types of postlexical rules (Kiparsky 1985):
  1. Gradient *phonetic* outputs
  2. Categorical *phonological* outputs
- Coarticulation = gradient phonetic phenomenon
- Assimilation = categorical phonological phenomenon
- Zsiga (1995): Lexical /S/ (as in "mesh", "impression") = categorical properties
- Postlexical /S/ (as in "miss you") = gradient progression between /s/ and /S/

### Prosodic Effects on Allophony (pp. 31-32)
- Pierrehumbert & Talkin (1992): Allophony of glottal stop and /h/ depends on prosodic environment
- Pierrehumbert & Frisch (1997): Glottalization critical for natural-sounding synthesis
- Requires "running window over a fully parsed phonological structure"

### Light and Dark /l/ Allophones (pp. 34-35)
- Sproat & Fujimura (1993): No categorical distinction between light [l] and dark [l] in English
- Variation depends on: syllable position, duration of prosodic context
- Mapping from abstract phonological representation to pronunciation does NOT require intermediate allophone level

### Lexical vs. Postlexical Rules (pp. 35-37)
- Lexical phonology (Kiparsky 1982): Lexical rules apply before words enter phrasal contexts
- Postlexical rules apply within and between words after contexts established
- Examples of voicing assimilation:
  - Lexical: a[dz], a[ps] (obstruent-triggered, anticipatory)
  - Postlexical: back[t], bagg[d], bann[d], kidd[id] (sonorant-triggered, perseverative)

### Prosodic Hierarchy (p. 38)
- Nespor & Vogel (1986) prosodic domains (bottom to top):
  - syllable, foot, phonological word, clitic group, phonological phrase, intonational phrase, phonological utterance

### Kaisse's (1985) Postlexical Rule Types (pp. 38-39)
1. Suppletive allomorphs listed in lexicon (cliticization)
2. External sandhi rules (syntactic/morphological/lexical conditions)
3. Fast speech rules (rate and phonological information only)
- P1 rules: categorical, apply in smaller prosodic domains
- P2 rules: gradient, apply in larger prosodic domains

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Allophones (pp. 39-40)
- Randolph (1989):
  - Extrinsic: phonetic alternations attributed to structural context (syllable position)
  - Intrinsic: phonetic alternations from "inherent mechanical constraints on articulatory mechanism"
- Examples of extrinsic allophones: aspirated/unaspirated/glottalized/released/unreleased/flapped/retroflexed /t/, light/dark /l/

### Mohanan's Postlexical Module (p. 40)
- Two submodules:
  1. Syntactic submodule (syntax available)
  2. Postsyntactic module of phonetic implementation (syntax not available)
- English *a/an* alternation: example of rule at syntactic stratum

### Function Words (pp. 42-43)
- Function words have "strong" and "weak" forms (Selkirk 1984)
- Weak forms: stresslessness, possible vowel/consonant deletion
- Function words must be "sufficiently close" syntactically to adjacent words
- Principle of Categorial Invisibility of Function Words (PCI)
- Many function word alternations attributed to allomorphy (word-specific processes)

### Prosodically Conditioned Variation (p. 43)
- Dissertation models "prosodically conditioned allophony and allomorphy"
- Conflates: traditional allophony (flapping), phonologically conditioned allomorphy, function word destressing

### Sociolinguistic Variation (pp. 43-47)
- Distinguished from phonological optionality and phonetic variation
- Includes stylistic, geographical, and social class variation
- Speech community variation, accommodation, audience design
- Inter- vs. intra-speaker variation important for synthesis
- Kiparsky (1995): Historical lexical diffusion changes often lexical; neogrammarian sound changes often postlexical

### Evaluation Dimensions for Synthetic Speech (pp. 50-51)
- Four main axes:
  1. **Intelligibility**: segmental-level word identification
  2. **Comprehensibility**: understanding passages (sentences, paragraphs)
  3. **Acceptability/Preference/Quality**: listener reaction ("like it or not")
  4. **Naturalness**: related to acceptability but attempts to isolate human-likeness

### Intelligibility Tests (pp. 51-53)
- Modified Rhyme Test (MRT): 6 choices per item
- Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT): 2 choices, diagnostic on acoustic features
- Transcription task: subjects type heard word
- Bradlow et al. (1996): Speakers with larger vowel spaces more intelligible
- Duration of /s/ between words affects syllable affiliation detection

### Comprehensibility (pp. 53-56)
- Process of building coherent propositional representation (Kintsch & van Dijk 1978)
- Successive vs. simultaneous measures:
  - Successive: recall, recognition, sentence verification (after presentation)
  - Simultaneous: phoneme/word monitoring (real-time)
- Natural speech > Votrax on word monitoring accuracy and latency
- Subjects listening to synthetic speech allocate more resources to acoustic-phonetic processing

### Acceptability (pp. 57-58)
- Motorola synthesizer judged more acceptable than 3 commercial synthesizers
- But lagged in segmental intelligibility
- Possible mismatch between acceptability and intelligibility
- Rating scale: 1 ("would not use") to 7 ("would prefer"), 4 = "acceptable"

### Naturalness (pp. 58-62)
- Synthetic speech differs in: prosodic structure, segmental structure, source characteristics
- Segmental duration, timing, intonation, amplitude variation under rule control
- May show less variability than human speech
- Even single glottal pulses distinguishable as natural vs. synthetic
- Tests: Single vowel discrimination (/i/, /a/, /u/); lexical prosody tests
- Only /i/ diagnostic for naturalness (human > synthetic)
- DECtalk judged more natural than human speech for /u/!

### Postlexical Variation Case Studies (pp. 62-65)
- **Portele (1997)**: German schwa deletion study
  - Phoneticians preferred reduced forms
  - Naive listeners preferred unreduced forms
  - "Synthetic speech is perceived differently from natural speech"
- **Sorin (1991)**: French mute *e* study
  - When mute *e* elided in synthesis: word identification substantially lower
  - Intermediate mute *e* pronunciation: identification scores match natural speech with all elided
  - But preference ratings: all pronounced mute *e* judged worst (least natural)
  - Tension between intelligibility and naturalness

### Motorola Synthesizer Comparison (p. 65)
- Motorola synthesizers: better acceptability (p < .05) but worse intelligibility than 2 of 3 others
- Past: intelligibility was primary measure (severe problems)
- Today: intelligibility differences less glaring, acceptability judgments based more on naturalness

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "...it should no longer be taken for granted that two allophones, even ones as apparently different as the [t^h] and [?] of /t/ represent two distinct categories: we expect that variation in such cases will also prove to be graded, once enough contexts are considered and sufficient articulatory data are examined." (Sproat & Fujimura 1993, 309) - p. 35

> "gradient processes...form a 'cline'...(and) appear to be simply the postlexical applications of rules which in the lexicon function in strictly categorical fashion" (Kiparsky 1985, 94) - p. 37

> "the larger prosodic domains are less grammaticalized than clitic groups or phonological phrases. They are not nearly so intimately related to, nor derived from, syntactic categories and syntactic concepts" (Kaisse 1990, 129) - p. 39

> "The data are consistent with the hypotheses that comprehension is constrained by a limited capacity of processing resources that can be allocated to various comprehension sub-processes as well as other cognitive processes. Subjects listening to synthetic speech apparently allocate a greater proportion of the available resources to acoustic-phonetic processing, leaving relatively fewer resources for analysis of the linguistic meaning of the passage." (Ralston et al. 1995, 271) - p. 56

> "Synthetische Sprache wird jedoch anders perzipiert als naturliche Sprache, bei letzterer werden kanonische Realisierungen kaum toleriert, wahrend synthetische Sprache durchaus 'deutlich' klingen darf" [Synthetic speech is perceived differently from natural speech; in the latter, canonical realizations are hardly tolerated, while synthetic speech must sound thoroughly precise] (Portele 1997) - p. 63

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Postlexical Module
1. **Prosodic hierarchy is essential**: Rules apply at different prosodic levels (P1 in smaller domains, P2 in larger)
2. **Glottalization requires running window**: Need fully parsed phonological structure to determine where to glottalize
3. **Function words need special handling**: Strong/weak form selection depends on syntactic proximity and stress
4. **Trade-off between naturalness and intelligibility**: Reduced forms sound more natural but may reduce intelligibility
5. **Categorical vs. gradient distinction matters**: Some phenomena (lexical palatalization) are categorical; others (postlexical palatalization like "miss you") are gradient

### For Neural Network Approaches
- Input encoding: 1-of-n for letters (local representation)
- Output encoding: Distributed features for phonemes
- Hidden layers learn phonological features (consonantal, frontness, sonority)
- Recurrent networks (Elman, Jordan) useful for harmony/phonotactic patterns

### Evaluation Strategy
- Don't rely solely on intelligibility tests
- Acceptability and naturalness become more important as base intelligibility improves
- Postlexical variation may hurt intelligibility but improve naturalness/acceptability
