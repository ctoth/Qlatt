## Key Citations for Follow-up

1. **Holmes, Mattingly, and Shearme (1964)** - "Speech Synthesis by Rule" - This is the foundational paper Strong contrasts his approach with. Holmes et al. used spectrographic analysis and listening to modify rules; Strong instead extracts detailed parameters to compare against. Essential for understanding the two competing approaches to synthesis-by-rule development.

2. **Noll (1964)** - "Cepstrum Techniques for Vocal Pitch Detection" - The F0 extraction method Strong uses is based on Noll's cepstrum technique. Relevant for understanding pitch tracking algorithms and their limitations in weak voicing regions.

3. **Griffiths (1966)** - "Modified Rhyme Test" - The intelligibility test methodology used for evaluation. Understanding this test format is important for interpreting the error rate results and comparing to other synthesizer evaluations.
