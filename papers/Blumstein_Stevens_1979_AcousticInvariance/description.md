This paper demonstrates that stop consonant place of articulation can be classified with approximately 85% accuracy using three invariant spectral templates applied at consonantal release, independent of vowel context, voicing, syllable position, and speaker. The three templates are diffuse-rising energy for alveolars, diffuse-falling energy for labials, and a compact midfrequency peak for velars, derived from quantitative analysis of 1800 utterances across multiple speakers and conditions. For speech synthesis, these findings establish that burst spectra must match specific spectral shapes to convey place of articulation correctly, making them essential design constraints for Klatt stop consonant synthesis.
