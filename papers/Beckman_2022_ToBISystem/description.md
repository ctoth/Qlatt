This paper presents the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) transcription system, a standardized phonological framework for annotating prosodic features including pitch accents, boundary tones, and juncture strength in spoken English. The key contributions include the complete MAE_ToBI annotation conventions with a 4-point break index scale, an inventory of pitch accents (H*, L*, L+H*, L*+H, H+!H*) and boundary tones, and the AM+ theoretical extension proposing five pitch levels (EH, H, M, L, EL) with feature specifications. For speech synthesis, ToBI provides the essential mapping between phonological prosodic labels and phonetic F0 targets, enabling principled generation of intonation patterns, phrase boundaries, and pitch range dynamics.
