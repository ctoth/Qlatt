# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Data collected from tomograms indicate that a lowered larynx - typical of professional male singing - increases the laryngeal ventricle, the sinus piriformes and the cross-sectional area in the lower pharynx. The effects of such changes on the formant frequencies are studied by means of measurements on an acoustical tube-model of the vocal tract. The results indicate that the larynx tube can act as a separate Helmholtz resonator the resonance frequency of which can be tuned to a frequency between those of the third and fourth length resonances of the vocal tract. The condition for generating such an extra formant is that the laryngeal ventricle and the cross-sectional area in the lower pharynx are sufficiently large. The sinus piriformes seem to increase the effective length of the pharynx, thus lowering those formant frequencies in particular that are due to standing waves in the pharynx. In this way the formant frequency changes accompanying a lowering of the larynx appear to explain the "singing formant" as well as other major formant frequency differences between spoken and professionally sung vowels.

## Our Interpretation

The "singing formant" (the characteristic 3 kHz spectral peak in professional male singing) results from specific articulatory and acoustic mechanisms triggered by larynx lowering. Sundberg demonstrates through X-ray tomography and acoustic tube modeling that the lowered larynx creates two key acoustic effects: (1) the larynx tube itself acts as a Helmholtz resonator tuned to ~2.8 kHz, creating an extra formant between normal F3 and F4, and (2) the enlarged sinus piriformes creates a spectral zero at 3-4 kHz through quarter-wave resonance. Together, these mechanisms produce approximately 20 dB of spectral gain in the 3 kHz region, entirely explained by changes in pharyngeal cavity dimensions rather than any external "head resonance" or "chest resonance."
