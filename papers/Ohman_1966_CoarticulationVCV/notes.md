**Author:** S. E. G. Öhman
**Year:** 1966
**Venue:** The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 39, pp. 151-168
**DOI:** 10.1121/1.1909864

## One-Sentence Summary

This paper demonstrates that formant transitions in VCV utterances are not determined solely by the consonant but depend on the entire vowel context, with the stop-consonant gesture superimposed on a continuous underlying vowel-to-vowel (diphthongal) gesture.

## Problem Addressed

The "locus theory" from Haskins Laboratories proposed fixed characteristic frequencies (loci) where formant transitions begin or point to for each consonant. Öhman investigates whether these loci are truly fixed or whether they vary depending on vowel context, examining the dynamic rules governing coarticulation in connected speech.

## Key Contributions

1. **Demonstrated non-unique loci**: Terminal frequencies of formant transitions depend not only on the consonant but on the *entire* VCV context—both preceding and following vowels
2. **Proposed diphthongal substrate model**: VCV articulation = basic vowel-to-vowel gesture + superimposed consonant gesture
3. **Quantified coarticulation ranges**: Average F2 terminal frequency variation of 280 cps due to transconsonantal vowel influence
4. **Cross-linguistic comparison**: Swedish and English show free coarticulation; Russian palatalized consonants constrain it
5. **Physiological model**: Three semi-independent articulatory control channels (apical, dorsal, vowel body)

## Methodology

### Speakers
- Swedish male (investigator): 48 VCV words (4 vowels × 3 stops × 4 vowels)
- Swedish male (naive subject): 75 VCV words (5 vowels × 3 stops × 5 vowels), 5 repetitions each
- American English male: 18 VCV words (/i, a, u/ × /d, g/ × /i, a, u/)
- Russian male: VCV words with /e/ + consonant + various vowels

### Vowels Used
- **Swedish:** /y/, /ø/, /ɑ/, /o/, /u/ (all rounded)
- **American English:** /i/, /a/, /u/

### Consonants
- Voiced stops: /b/, /d/, /g/
- Swedish /d/ is apico-dental (not apico-alveolar like English)

### Measurements
- Wide-band spectrograms (Kay Sona-Graph, 0-4500 Hz expanded scale)
- F1, F2, F3 frequencies measured at:
  - Stationary parts of vowels
  - Beginning and end of stop closure
- Measurement accuracy: <50 cps for F2

### Segmentation Criteria for Stop Boundaries
- **Closure onset:** Substantial decrease in amplitude of F2+ formants; downward F1 shift
- **Closure offset:** Weak burst spike; rapid F1 frequency increase
- **Extrapolation rule:** If formant not visible at boundary, assume it continues into gap without slope change

## Key Findings

### 1. Formant Transition Variability (Table I, IV)

The terminal frequency of F2 in any VC or CV sequence varies significantly depending on the transconsonantal vowel:

| Formant | Average Range of Variation | Maximum Range |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------|
| F1 | 62 cps | 130 cps |
| F2 | 280 cps | 540 cps |
| F3 | 153 cps | 330 cps |

### 2. Statistical Significance (Table VI)

Critical differences at p < 0.01:
- F1: 57 cps
- F2: 118 cps
- F3: 115 cps

Most F2 ranges exceed critical values → coarticulation effect is real, not measurement noise.

### 3. Anticipatory Coarticulation Example

In /øgy/ vs /øgɑ/ (Fig. 1):
- Same initial vowel /ø/, same consonant /g/
- F2 transition in /ø/ **rises** when final vowel is /y/ (front)
- F2 transition in /ø/ **falls** when final vowel is /ɑ/ (back)
- The *following* vowel affects the *preceding* VC transition

### 4. Carryover Coarticulation Example

In /ydø/ vs /odø/ (Fig. 2):
- Same final vowel /ø/, same consonant /d/
- F2 transition in final /ø/ differs based on initial vowel
- The *preceding* vowel affects the *following* CV transition

### 5. Non-Unique Loci (Fig. 5)

For /ø/ + consonant sequences:
- /d/ transition range completely overlaps /g/ transition range
- A frequency region around 1450 cps exists where any of /b, d, g/ could be the consonant
- Terminal frequency alone carries NO place-of-articulation information in some contexts

### 6. Locus Frequency Dependence on Context (Fig. 11)

CV loci for /b/ and /d/ vary systematically with the preceding vowel:
- /b/ locus ranges from 500 cps (after /u/) to 1300 cps (after /y/)
- /d/ locus shows similar context-dependent variation

### 7. S-Shaped F2 Transitions in VgV

In back-vowel + /g/ + front-vowel sequences (e.g., /ogy/, /ugy/):
- F2 first rises (~40 ms), then falls toward target
- Explained by tongue constriction passing through F2 maximum region during release
- Not time-reversed version of front→back transitions

### 8. Russian Comparison (Table IX)

Russian palatalized/velarized consonants show minimal coarticulation:
- F2 transition ranges only 45-120 cps (vs 280+ cps in Swedish/English)
- Exception: unpalatalized /g/ shows 570 cps range (but /g/+front vowel is phonotactically restricted)

### 9. Fricatives vs Stops

Preliminary observations suggest fricatives do NOT exhibit the same coarticulation freedom as stops—different coarticulation rules apply.

## Key Equations

No formal equations, but key quantitative relationships:

**Standard deviation of terminal frequency measurements:**
$$\sigma_{F1} = 35 \text{ cps}, \quad \sigma_{F2} = 75 \text{ cps}, \quad \sigma_{F3} = 70 \text{ cps}$$

**Sample comparison standard deviation:**
$$\sigma' = \sigma \sqrt{2/n}$$

For n=5 samples: $\sigma'_{F1} = 21$ cps, $\sigma'_{F2} = 48$ cps, $\sigma'_{F3} = 45$ cps

## Parameters

| Parameter | Symbol | Units | Value/Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| F2 of /y/ (Swedish) | F2 | cps | 2000 | Male speaker, stationary portion |
| F2 of /ø/ (Swedish) | F2 | cps | 1600 | Male speaker, stationary portion |
| F2 of /ɑ/ (Swedish) | F2 | cps | 1000 | Male speaker, stationary portion |
| F2 of /u/ (Swedish) | F2 | cps | 650 | Male speaker, stationary portion |
| F2 variation range | ΔF2 | cps | 210 (avg), 380 (max) | Due to transconsonantal vowel |
| Measurement accuracy | - | cps | <50 | For F2 from spectrograms |
| F2 maximum location | x | cm | 13 | Distance from glottis (Fant model) |
| S-curve rise duration | - | ms | ~40 | In back→/g/→front transitions |

## Physiological Model

### Three Independent Articulatory Control Channels:

1. **Apical constriction system** - controls tongue tip (for /d/)
2. **Dorsal constriction system** - controls tongue dorsum (for /g/)
3. **Vowel/tongue-body system** - controls overall tongue shape

These systems:
- Share some muscles but have separate neural representations
- Can be controlled independently
- Responses combine through neural, muscular, and mechanical summation

### VCV Production Model:

```
VCV utterance = V1-to-V2 diphthongal gesture + superimposed C gesture
```

- Consonant gesture does NOT interrupt vowel gesture
- Consonant gesture is superimposed on transitional portion of diphthong
- Some vowel instruction components are inhibited during consonant if antagonistic

### Language-Specific Constraints:

- **Swedish/English:** Stop consonants coarticulate freely with vowels (apical/dorsal commands only)
- **Russian:** Stops require simultaneous fixed vowel command ([i] for palatalized, [ɨ] for velarized)

## Results Summary

1. Stop consonant formant transitions are NOT characterized by fixed locus frequencies
2. Terminal frequencies vary by ~280 cps (F2 average) depending on transconsonantal vowel
3. The following vowel influences the preceding VC transition (anticipatory)
4. The preceding vowel influences the following CV transition (carryover)
5. VCV perception likely requires analysis of entire pattern, not just terminal frequencies
6. The articulatory system "prepares" for upcoming segments during preceding segments
7. Lip rounding effects exist but lingual factors dominate the observed coarticulation

## Limitations

- Only voiced stops studied systematically
- Fricatives mentioned but not analyzed in detail
- Only three languages examined
- X-ray data only from one speaker (the investigator)
- Model is qualitative/hypothesized, not formally validated
- Timing relationships of instruction components remain unclear

## Relevance to Qlatt Project

### Direct Implementation Applications:

1. **Formant transition targets should be context-dependent:**
   - Current: Fixed CV/VC transition endpoints per consonant
   - Better: Endpoints modulated by transconsonantal vowel F2

2. **Implement anticipatory coarticulation:**
   - Start moving toward V2 target during V1→C transition
   - Don't wait for consonant release to begin V2 approach

3. **Implement carryover coarticulation:**
   - CV transition should reflect where it came from (V1)
   - Not just where it's going (V2)

4. **Model as superimposed gestures:**
   - Vowel trajectory: smooth V1→V2 interpolation
   - Consonant: perturbation overlaid on vowel trajectory
   - Not: V1 → C_locus → V2 with independent transitions

5. **Different rules for different consonant classes:**
   - Stops: free coarticulation
   - Fricatives: more constrained (per Öhman's observations)

### Specific Parameter Guidance:

- F2 transition endpoints should vary by ~280 cps based on context
- Consider implementing context-dependent "locus modulation" table
- S-shaped transitions needed for back-vowel → /g/ → front-vowel

## Open Questions

- [ ] How to formalize the "superimposed gesture" model computationally?
- [ ] What are the precise timing relationships for anticipatory effects?
- [ ] Do fricatives really not coarticulate, or just differently?
- [ ] How do nasals fit into this model?
- [ ] What controls the degree of coarticulation (speech rate, emphasis)?

## Key Quotes

> "The second-formant transition in the vowel preceding the stop is rising when the vowel following the stop is /y/, but it is falling when the vowel following the stop is /u/." (p. 151)

> "There is even a frequency region around 1450 cps such that, if a second-formant transition from /ø/ terminates there, it may be associated with any one of the three stops /b/, /d/, and /g/. Here is, accordingly, a case in which the second-formant terminal frequency alone carries no information whatsoever about the place of articulation of the stop." (p. 158)

> "A VCV utterance of the kind studied here can, accordingly, not be regarded as a linear sequence of three successive gestures. We have clear evidence that the stop-consonant gestures are actually superimposed on a context-dependent vowel substrate that is present during all of the consonantal gesture." (p. 165)

> "The freedom of coarticulation of the Russian stops is small. Apparently, these stops must always be coarticulated with one of two fixed vowels, the palatal [i] or the velar [ɨ]." (p. 168)
