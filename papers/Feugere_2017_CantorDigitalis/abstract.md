# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Cantor Digitalis is a performative singing synthesizer that is composed of two main parts: a chironomic control interface and a parametric voice synthesizer. The control interface is based on a pen/touch graphic tablet equipped with a template representing vocalic and melodic spaces. Hand and pen positions, pen pressure, and a graphical user interface are assigned to specific vocal controls. This interface allows for real-time accurate control over high-level singing synthesis parameters. The sound generation system is based on a parametric synthesizer that features a spectral voice source model, a vocal tract model consisting of parallel filters for vocalic formants and cascaded with anti-resonance for the spectral effect of hypo-pharynx cavities, and rules for parameter settings and source/filter dependencies between fundamental frequency, vocal effort, and formants. Because Cantor Digitalis is a parametric system, every aspect of voice quality can be controlled (e.g., vocal tract size, aperiodicities in the voice source, vowels, and so forth). It offers several presets for different voice types. Cantor Digitalis has been played on stage in several public concerts, and it has also been proven to be useful as a tool for voice pedagogy. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive technical overview of Cantor Digitalis.

## Our Interpretation

Cantor Digitalis combines a gestural interface (pen/touch tablet) with a sophisticated parametric formant synthesizer to enable real-time expressive singing synthesis, using rules that link high-level musical controls (pitch, vowel, effort) to low-level synthesis parameters while modeling source-filter dependencies including f0-dependent formant tuning and vocal effort effects on spectral tilt. This work demonstrates that formant synthesis can achieve high-quality, musically controllable singing voices suitable for live performance and educational applications, offering an alternative to concatenative and statistical approaches by prioritizing real-time expressiveness and parametric flexibility.
