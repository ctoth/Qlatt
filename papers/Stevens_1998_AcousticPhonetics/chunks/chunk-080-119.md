## Key Findings

### Glottal Vibration Conditions
- Vocal fold vibration requires: transglottal pressure (P_s), vocal fold adduction, and appropriate compliance
- Condition for vibration: P_s * d_1 * C'_1 + x_0 > (-x_0), where d_1 = thickness of lower vocal fold, C'_1 = mechanical compliance, x_0 = rest position
- Minimum glottal width ~0.12 cm needed for vibration initiation
- Subglottal pressure ~8 cm H2O corresponds to airflow ~300 cm^3/s (females) and 450 cm^3/s (males)
- At least 3 cm H2O transglottal pressure needed for vibration even with optimal parameters

### Voice Quality Parameters (Critical for Synthesis)
- **Modal voicing**: Normal vocal fold tension, typical period ~8 ms for males
- **Pressed voicing (creaky voice)**: Vocal folds pushed tightly together, smaller glottal pulse area, rate of change during closing phase similar, spectrum amplitude greater at high frequencies (1-2 kHz bulge), spectrum lower at low frequencies
- **Breathy voicing**: Arytenoid cartilages separated, continuous airflow through posterior glottis, interarytenoid space ~0.03 cm^2 leads to ~110 cm^3/s DC airflow
  - Spectrum ~6 dB weaker above 2000 Hz vs modal
  - First harmonic amplitude approximately equal to first-harmonic amplitude for modal vibration when transitioning
  - High-frequency amplitude 15 dB weaker than modal voicing

### LF Model Parameters (Fant et al., 1985)
- Key parameters: E_o (amplitude), F_g (fundamental frequency), T_o (fundamental period), OQ (open quotient), T_2 (return time constant)
- Derivative of glottal airflow: U'_g(t) = E_o * e^(at) * sin(2*pi*F_g*t) for 0 < t < T_1
- T_1 = OQ * T_o, where OQ = fraction of cycle glottis is open (typically 0.5)
- T_2 parameter controls high-frequency slope: T_2 = 0 gives abrupt return, T_2 = 0.1 ms gives gradual return
- Changing OQ from 0.5 to 0.7: H1-H2 difference changes from -5 dB to +5 dB

### Rosenberg/Klatt Model (Equation 2.19)
- U'_g(t) = a(2t - 3t^2/(OQ * T_o)) for interval 0 < t < OQ * T_o
- Parameters: amplitude a, frequency 1/T_o, open quotient OQ, return time T_2

## Formant Data
- Not directly covered in this chunk (focuses on source mechanisms rather than formants)

## Rules/Algorithms

### Turbulence Noise Generation Rules
1. **Three mechanisms** for turbulence noise at constriction:
   - Free jet from constriction exit (dipole source)
   - Obstacle in airstream downstream (dipole source)
   - Fluctuations in airstream within constriction (monopole source)

2. **Dipole vs Monopole Sources**:
   - Dipole: fluctuating force at obstacle/surface, 30 dB stronger than model without obstacle
   - Monopole: velocity fluctuations at constriction exit, couples weakly to tube modes at low frequencies, dominates at low frequencies (< 3 kHz)

3. **Turbulence Source Scaling**:
   - Sound power proportional to U^6 (velocity to 6th power)
   - Pressure proportional to Delta-P^3 (pressure drop cubed)
   - Sound pressure proportional to Delta-P^(3/2) * A^(1/2)

### Voiced vs Voiceless Fricative Rules
- Voiced fricative: intraoral pressure ~50% of subglottal pressure
- Voiceless fricative: intraoral pressure ~80-90% of subglottal pressure
- Turbulence source for voiced fricative ~7 dB below voiceless (20*log(0.6^1.5) = 7 dB)
- Voiced cognates (e.g., /v/ vs /f/) noise may be inaudible or quite weak

### Stop Release Transient Rules
1. Initial burst: cross-sectional area increases exponentially
2. Initial rate of area increase:
   - Labials: ~100 cm^2/s
   - Alveolars: ~25-100 cm^2/s (slower due to cineradiographic data)
   - Velars: ~25 cm^2/s
3. Burst duration within 5 dB of maximum: ~9-19 ms depending on rate of opening
4. Transient source magnitude comparable to glottal pulse at high frequencies (>1000 Hz)

### Glottal Configuration Effects on Voicing
- Normal modal voicing requires glottal constriction with appropriate pressure gradient
- Constriction area < 0.1-0.2 cm^2 causes significant effects on airflow waveform
- At 0.07 cm^2 constriction, vocal fold vibration ceases due to transglottal pressure becoming too small
- Volume contraction (raising larynx, advancing tongue root, raising soft palate) can extend voicing

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Vibration will be inhibited if the subglottal pressure is too small, if the vocal folds are too thin (i.e., d_1 is small), if the vocal folds are too stiff (i.e., C'_1 is small), or if the vocal folds are pushed tightly together (|x_0| is large)." (p. 80)

> "For breathy voicing, the spectrum above 2000 Hz is about 6 dB weaker, on average, for the leak condition in relation to the modal condition." (p. 87)

> "The sound pressure source for a voiced fricative is expected to be about 7 dB below that for a voiceless fricative if voicing is to be maintained (since 20 log 0.6^1.5 = 7 dB)." (p. 112)

> "At the release of a stop consonant, the initial rate of increase of the cross-sectional area of the constriction... for labials, the initial value of dA_c/dt is probably about the same for alveolar stop consonants. For velar stops, the initial rate of increase of area is slower; cineradiographic and acoustic data given in section 1.3.3 indicate that this rate is about 25 cm^2/s." (p. 119)

> "The brief transient flow through the constriction at the release can be represented by a volume velocity source located at the constriction." (p. 119)

## Implementation Notes

### Voice Quality Control in Klatt Synthesizer
1. **OQ (Open Quotient)** parameter directly controls H1-H2 difference:
   - OQ = 0.5: H1-H2 ~ -5 dB (modal)
   - OQ = 0.7: H1-H2 ~ +5 dB (breathy)

2. **Spectral Tilt** for voice quality:
   - Pressed voice: boost 1-2 kHz, reduce low frequencies
   - Breathy voice: reduce high frequencies by ~6 dB above 2 kHz, ~15 dB reduction possible

3. **AH (Aspiration) parameter** should model:
   - DC airflow component during breathy voicing
   - Interarytenoid leak (~110 cm^3/s typical)

### Fricative Noise Source Implementation
1. **Source location**: Consider both dipole (obstacle) and monopole (constriction exit) sources
2. **Spectral shape**: Broad peak at frequency proportional to u/d (velocity/cross-dimension)
   - For d = 0.32 cm, u = 2000-5200 cm/s: peak at 600-1600 Hz
3. **Level scaling**: Proportional to U^3 * A^(-2.5)
4. **Voiced vs voiceless**: ~7 dB difference due to reduced pressure drop

### Stop Burst Implementation
1. **Rise time**: Use exponential area increase A_c(t)
2. **Duration**: ~9-19 ms depending on place of articulation
3. **Initial rate** (dA_c/dt):
   - Labials: 100 cm^2/s
   - Alveolars: 40-100 cm^2/s
   - Velars: 25 cm^2/s
4. **Transient source** can be comparable to periodic glottal source at high frequencies

### Key Insight for Voiced Stops
- During voiced stop closure, intraoral pressure builds up to subglottal pressure over ~30 ms
- Time constant for pressure buildup: R_g = rho*U_g/(2*A_g^2), C_w determines RC time constant
- Voicing can continue briefly after closure through active volume reduction
