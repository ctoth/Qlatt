- **[3] Klatt & Klatt 1990** - Foundational work on voice quality variations and formant synthesis parameters; directly cited for synthesis techniques used in this paper and for understanding perceptual aspects of voice quality that hybrid synthesis addresses.

- **[1] Hertz, Younes & Zinovieva 1999** - Details the ETI-Eloquence text-to-speech system that forms the basis of the formant synthesis rules used in these hybrid experiments; essential for understanding the rule system being improved.

- **[4] Hertz 1991** - Presents the phone-and-transition model underlying Hertz's phonological approach to formant timing; foundational for understanding her theory of phonetic segmentation and transitions.

- **[2] Verhelst 2000** - Describes the WSOLA join technique used to splice waveform fragments in the hybrid utterances; technically important for understanding the concatenation methodology.

- **[5] Hertz & Huffman 1992** - Presents nucleus-based timing models for speech synthesis; relevant for understanding prosodic and durational aspects of synthesis-by-rule.
