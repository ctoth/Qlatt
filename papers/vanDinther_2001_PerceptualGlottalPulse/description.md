This paper investigates the perceptual relevance of the three parameters in the LF glottal pulse model by measuring discrimination thresholds for parameter variations and comparing them against excitation pattern distances computed from an auditory model. The key findings show that the LF model effectively operates as a 1-2 parameter system perceptually, with the return phase parameter (Ra) being most audible, followed by asymmetry (Rk), while open phase duration (Ro) has negligible perceptual impact. These results are important for speech synthesis because they demonstrate that voice quality control can be simplified by focusing computational effort on the most perceptually relevant parameter (return phase spectral tilt) rather than trying to independently vary all three LF parameters.
