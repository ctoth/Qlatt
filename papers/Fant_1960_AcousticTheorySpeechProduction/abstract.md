# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This monograph is intended as a contribution to the understanding of the relations between physiological data concerning speech production and physical data from the description of the speech wave. One part of this task is general in character and involves a survey of the theoretical foundations of the description of speech signals and of the prediction of acoustic signals from articulatory data. Part I is devoted to the general theory of speech production and calculation techniques with an emphasis on the acoustics of compound resonator systems which is treated on the basis of equivalent circuit theory. It serves as a theoretical foundation for the specific studies undertaken in Part II as well as a reference for the theory of simple resonator systems and the theory of sound sources in speech, dealt with in the appendices.

Part II presents the results of calculations based on the X-ray studies of Russian articulations. The production of all standard Russian vowels and consonants was X-rayed in 1951, and these records and calculations have been prepared as a part of the project "Description and Analysis of Contemporary Standard Russian", directed by R. Jakobson in connection with the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University, under the sponsorship of the Rockefeller Foundation.

The main object of these calculations was to attempt a reconstruction of the spectra of speech sounds from physiological data of their production. This involves a comparison of samples of connected speech with corresponding data derived from sustained forms of articulation during X-ray photography. Some critical comments on the traditional pattern of articulatory descriptions are added. Part III provides a summary of the relations between articulation and speech wave, with applications to the theory of distinctive features.

## Our Interpretation

Fant's 1960 monograph establishes the complete mathematical and physical framework for understanding how speech sounds are produced, combining theoretical acoustic theory with empirical X-ray data to derive the specific resonator configurations, transfer functions, and source characteristics needed for speech synthesis. The foundational contribution is the source-filter model (P = S × T), which decomposes any speech spectrum into an independent source component and a vocal tract filter component, providing the theoretical basis for all modern formant synthesizers including Klatt. By providing detailed equations for bandwidth calculations, formant frequencies, source spectra, and articulatory-acoustic mappings across vowels, consonants, and nasals, this work supplies the complete set of parameters and empirical targets necessary for implementing realistic speech synthesis systems.
