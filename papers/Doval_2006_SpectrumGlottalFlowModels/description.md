This paper unifies four glottal flow models (KLGLOTT88, Rosenberg C, R++, and LF) into a single 5-parameter framework and derives analytical spectral formulas showing how time-domain parameters map to spectral features. The key contributions are demonstrating that glottal formant frequency is controlled by open quotient (Oq) while bandwidth is controlled by asymmetry coefficient (αm), and proving that H1-H2 depends on both Oq and αm rather than Oq alone. This framework is essential for speech synthesis because it explains the spectral consequences of glottal parameter variations and reveals that KLGLOTT88's fixed αm value (2/3) prevents independent control of glottal formant bandwidth, a limitation that LF models overcome.
