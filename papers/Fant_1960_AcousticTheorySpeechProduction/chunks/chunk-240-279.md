## Equations Found

### Glottis Flow Resistance (Laminar)
$$
R_L = \frac{12\mu l}{A^3/b^2} \text{ (dyne sec/cm}^5\text{)}
$$
Where:
- $\mu = 1.84 \times 10^{-4}$ = viscosity coefficient
- $a = A/b$ = width of rectangular glottis slit
- $b = A/a$ = length in direction of slit
- $l$ = depth of slit

### Bernoulli Resistance
$$
R_B = p/u = \rho v/2A = \rho u/2A^2
$$
Where:
- $p$ = pressure fall at constriction
- $\rho$ = air density
- $v$ = particle velocity
- $A$ = glottis area
- $u$ = volume velocity

### Glottis Inductance
$$
L_q = \frac{\rho l}{A}
$$
Where:
- $\rho$ = air density
- $l$ = glottis depth
- $A$ = glottis area

### Source Impedance Equation
$$
R_F(t) \cdot u(t) + L_q(t)\frac{du(t)}{dt} = p_q
$$
Where:
- $R_F(t)$ = time-varying flow resistance
- $u(t)$ = volume velocity
- $p_q$ = constant subglottal pressure

### Differential Flow Equation (Resistive dominance)
$$
\frac{\rho}{2}\frac{u^2(t)}{A^2(t)} + \frac{\rho l}{A(t)} \cdot \frac{du(t)}{dt} = p_q
$$

### Flow When Resistance Dominates
$$
u(t) = A(t)\sqrt{2p_q/\rho}
$$

### Flow When Inductance Dominates
$$
u(t) = \frac{p_q}{\rho l}\int A(t)dt
$$

### Differential Resistance
$$
R_D = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v A} = \rho u/A^2
$$
- Average differential resistance: $2 \times 15700/140 = 225$ acoustical ohms or $5\rho c$

### Reynolds Number
$$
Re = \frac{vh}{\nu}
$$
Where:
- $v$ = particle velocity (cm/sec)
- $h$ = effective width (cm)
- $\nu = 0.15$ cm^2/sec (kinematic coefficient of viscosity)

### Pressure Drop (Laminar Flow)
$$
\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta l} = \frac{\lambda}{d} \cdot \frac{\rho}{2} \cdot v^2 = 32\frac{\mu v}{d^2}
$$
Where:
- $\lambda = 0.3164 \cdot Re^{-1/4}$ (for turbulent flow)
- $d$ = diameter
- Proportional to $v^{7/4}$ under laminar conditions

### Velocity-Squared Pressure Drop
$$
p = \frac{\rho}{2}\left(\frac{u}{AK}\right)^2
$$
Where:
- $K$ = constant (0.7-0.9 for thin orifices)
- $A$ = area
- $u$ = volume velocity

### Noise Source Onset
$$
P_t = a(Re - Re_c)
$$
Where:
- $a$ = constant
- $Re_c$ = critical Reynolds number (~1800 for plastic tube models)

### Turbulent Noise Pressure
$$
P_t = k_1 h^2 p_d - k_2
$$
Where:
- $k_1, k_2$ = constants
- $h$ = effective width
- $p_d$ = pressure drop

### Stop Release Decay Time
$$
t_T = \frac{\rho V}{P_o A_o}\sqrt{2p_o/\rho}
$$
Where:
- $V$ = volume behind constriction
- $P_o$ = atmospheric pressure
- $A_o$ = final constriction area
- $p_o$ = initial over-pressure

### Flow Rate Equation
$$
dv = -\frac{P_o}{gV}A(t)dt
$$

### Particle Velocity During Stop Release
$$
v_o - v(t) = \frac{P_o A_o t}{gV}\left[1 - \frac{t_t}{t}(1 - e^{-t/t_t})\right]
$$
Where:
- $v_o = \sqrt{2p_o/\rho}$ = initial particle velocity
- $t_t$ = rise time
- $A(t) = A_o(1 - e^{-t/t_t})$ = exponential area function

## Vocal Tract Models

### Glottis as Electrical Analog
- Lung pressure modeled as constant DC voltage
- Glottis impedance in series with vocal tract input impedance
- Time-varying resistance $R_F(t)$ depends on glottis area
- Inductance $L_q$ from air mass in glottis
- Resistance has two terms: $R_F = R_L + R_T$
  - $R_L$ proportional to $A^{-3}$ (laminar, low flow)
  - $R_T$ proportional to $A^{-1}$ (turbulent, high flow)

### Flow Regimes
1. **Resistive dominance**: Flow proportional to glottis area
2. **Inductive dominance**: Flow is integral of area - gives 6 dB/octave faster spectrum fall
3. **Crossover**: ~2000 c/s estimated for normal voice

### Turbulence Model for Fricatives
- Critical Reynolds number determines turbulence onset
- For short constrictions: area more important than length
- Turbulent noise power proportional to:
  - Over-pressure squared
  - Particle velocity squared
  - Effective width h
- Spectrum envelope: -6 dB/octave for step function source

| F2 | 500 | 2500 |
| F3 | 1500 | 3500 |
| F4 | 2500 | 4500 |

### Bandwidths

- Higher formants: 40-200 c/s
- Bogert (1953) data systematically larger (different technique)

## Implementation Notes

### Voice Source Modeling
1. **Standard spectrum slope**: -12 dB/octave adopted for calculations
2. **Waveform shapes affect spectrum**: More rounded opening = weaker high frequencies
3. **Voice effort affects slope**: Higher effort = sharper onset = more high frequency energy
4. **Impedance crossover at ~2000 Hz**: Below this resistive, above this inductive behavior dominates

### Fricative Noise Generation
1. **Threshold exists**: Minimum overpressure needed (varies by place of articulation)
2. **[f] weakest**: Large width-to-height ratio reduces intensity
3. **Reynolds number criterion**: Re > Re_c (~1800) for turbulence
4. **Spectrum**: Flat at low frequencies with -6 dB/octave fall at high frequencies

### Stop Consonant Timing
1. **Burst interval**: ~70 msec for initial [p], [t], [k]
2. **Affricate duration**: Longer than stop burst, shorter than continuant
3. **Onset vs. decay**: Onset time determined by constriction area increase (t_t ~ 1 msec)
4. **Decay time**: Depends on back cavity volume, final area, initial overpressure

### Formant Measurement Considerations
1. **Frequency domain measurements give wider bandwidths** than time domain
2. **Spectral sections**: Three sampling points (I=explosion, II=frication, III=aspiration)
3. **Pre-filtering options**: B-curve, A-curve, various band-pass filters
4. **Time constant**: 10 msec integration (50 c/s low-pass cutoff)

### Key Implementation Values
- Voice source: -12 dB/octave slope
- Typical F1 bandwidth: 30-100 Hz
- Typical higher formant bandwidth: 40-200 Hz
- Stop burst duration: ~70 msec
- Fricative onset time: order of 1 msec
- Glottis inductance-resistance crossover: ~2000 Hz

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The voice fundamental frequency, see Eq. 1.1-2, is defined as 1/T_o where T_o is the duration of a fundamental period measured from an oscillogram or from the vertical striations in a broad-band spectrogram."

> "The bandwidth is defined as B = a/pi where 1/a is the time it takes for the oscillation to decay 8.6 dB, i.e., a factor e; see Fig. A.1-3."

> "The primary source of energy for the production of voiced sounds is the contraction of the respiratory muscles resulting in an over-pressure in the lungs and thus in an airflow that is periodically varied in magnitude owing to the opening and closing action of the so-called vocal cords, more recently called the vocal folds."

> "A simple mechanical explanation can be given on the basis of the alternating force exerted on the vocal folds by the subglottal over-pressure in the closed state and by the negative pressure in the glottis in the open state due to the flow of air. The latter sucking force, the Bernoulli effect, explains why the vocal folds can depart from an initial open state without muscle action."

> "The voice source spectrum utilized by Stevens et al. (1953) in the early work on the M.I.T. line analog is included for comparison in Fig. A.2-1. It differs from the other data by a less rapidly sloping spectrum envelope in the frequency range 100-1000 c/s."

> "The fricative element of a stop sound is quite similar to a short fricative continuant of the same articulation, but the later part of the noise interval preceding the onset of voicing in aspirated stops is to be considered as a short [h]-sound."

> "It is of some interest to note that the opposition of tense/lax for stops, sometimes referred to as fortis/lenis and defined by the noise duration, can, according to Eq. A.2-20, be maintained by either an open/closed glottis, which is the most effective means, or a slower/faster rate of area increase at the articulatory constriction and by a greater/smaller over-pressure behind the constriction."
