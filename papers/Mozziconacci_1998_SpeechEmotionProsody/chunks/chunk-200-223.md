## Key Findings

### Prosodic Parameters Studied
- **Pitch level** (mean F0)
- **Pitch range** (F0 excursion)
- **Speech rate** (overall duration)
- These three parameters are considered major contributors to conveying emotions

### Seven Emotions Studied
1. Neutrality
2. Joy
3. Boredom
4. Anger
5. Sadness
6. Fear
7. Indignation

### Main Results
- 63% correct identification of emotions was achieved using optimal prosodic parameter values in synthetic speech
- The '1&A' intonation pattern (prominence-lending rise-fall) was the most commonly used pattern across ALL seven emotions
- Patterns '12' (late rise followed by very late rise) and '3C' (late rise and very late fall) were NEVER used in neutral utterances - suggesting these patterns signal emotion
- Pitch and speech rate are powerful cues for conveying emotion
- Some emotions were identified less successfully than others - for these, other cues like voice quality, loudness, or other intonation properties may be essential

### Intonation Model Used
- Based on 't Hart, Collier and Cohen (1990) Dutch grammar of intonation
- Pitch curve = slowly decreasing component (declination line) + faster pitch movements superimposed
- End of declination line = pitch level
- Excursion size of pitch movements = pitch range
- Baseline (lower declination) and topline (upper declination) define the pitch movement space

### Duration Findings
- Temporal structure of emotional utterances changes NON-LINEARLY with some emotions
- Linear stretching/compression of entire utterance is NOT sufficient for emotion expression
- Differences in relative duration of accented vs. unaccented segments associated with EXPRESSION OF EMOTION were perceptually relevant for neutrality and indignation
- Accented segments should be stretched 40% MORE than unaccented segments for emotional expression

## F0/Prosody Patterns

### Intonation Patterns and Emotions
| Emotion | Preferred Final Pattern | Patterns to Avoid |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Neutrality | 1&A | 12 and 3C |
| Joy | 1&A and 5&A | A, EA, and 12 |
| Boredom | 3C | 5&A and 12 |
| Anger | 5&A, A and EA | 1&A and 3C |
| Sadness | 3C | 5&A |
| Fear | 12 and 3C | A and EA |
| Indignation | especially 12, but also 3C | 1&A |

### Key Prosodic Features by Emotion
| Emotion | Final Lowering | Relative Peak Height |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Neutrality | - | - |
| Joy | - | - |
| Boredom | no | - |
| Anger | - | - |
| Sadness | yes | yes |
| Fear | yes | yes |
| Indignation | yes | - |

### Duration Rules
- For neutrality and indignation: accented segments should be 40% longer than unaccented segments
- Linear time manipulation is generally NOT sufficient
- Non-linear manipulation (proportionally varying accented vs. unaccented segments) is needed for some emotions

## Voice Quality Parameters
- The thesis focuses primarily on F0, pitch range, and speech rate
- For some emotions (those less successfully identified), voice quality, loudness, or other intonation properties may be essential
- Specific voice quality parameters not detailed in these summary pages

## Formant Data
No formant data in these summary pages (thesis focuses on prosody, not spectral characteristics).

## Klatt Synthesizer Details
- Not explicitly mentioned in summary pages
- The thesis used speech synthesis for perception experiments
- Both "re-synthesized speech" (manipulated natural speech using PSOLA) and "synthetic speech" were used
- Rule-based synthetic speech was used in final experiments

## Figures of Interest
No figures in pages 200-223 (these are summary and index pages).

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Today's speech-synthesis systems do not compare with humans, even remotely, when it comes to exploiting prosodic variation. As a consequence, today's synthetic speech, despite the fact that it is considered reasonably intelligible, is also perceived as dull. It sounds rather unnatural and uninvolved." (page 200)

> "Modeling variability in synthetic speech is expected to enhance its quality and, therefore, to increase its potential use." (page 200)

> "In the present study, the variation of the prosodic elements: pitch level, pitch range, and speech rate was investigated in the vocal expression of emotion." (page 200)

> "Results showed that pitch and speech rate are powerful cues for conveying emotion in speech." (page 201)

> "The '1&A' pattern, a prominence-lending rise-fall, was the most often used pattern; it was regularly produced in all seven emotions." (page 203)

> "It was noticed that the patterns '12' (a rise followed by a very late rise) and '3C' (a late rise and a very late fall), were never used in final position in utterances expressing neutrality." (page 203)

> "The differences in relative duration of accented and unaccented speech segments that are associated with the expression of emotion, appeared to be perceptually very relevant for the expression of neutrality and indignation." (page 205)

### From Stellingen (Propositions) - page 223:

> "The way people interpret a spoken message does not only depend on the semantic content but also on the pitch, duration, and other prosodic properties of the utterance. These properties can be modeled in a quantitative way on the basis of results of both production and perception experiments." (Proposition 2)

> "A perceptual analysis of pitch curves resulting in a classification into intonation patterns helps in understanding the role of pitch in vocal expression of emotion." (Proposition 3)

> "In practicing speech research, feelings and emotions are frequently considered as 'noise'. They are, therefore, disregarded, often unjustly, in the process of identifying objective information." (Proposition 4)

## Implementation Notes

### Rules for Generating Emotional Speech (from Table on page 205/219)

For each emotion, apply these modifications to neutral speech:

**Joy:**
- Pitch level: 155 Hz (vs. 65 Hz neutral)
- Pitch range: 10 s.t. (vs. 5 s.t. neutral)
- Duration: 83% of neutral (faster)
- Prefer patterns: 1&A and 5&A
- Avoid patterns: A, EA, and 12

**Boredom:**
- Pitch level: 65 Hz (same as neutral)
- Pitch range: 4 s.t. (narrower than neutral)
- Duration: 150% of neutral (much slower)
- No final lowering
- Prefer pattern: 3C
- Avoid patterns: 5&A and 12

**Anger:**
- Pitch level: 110 Hz
- Pitch range: 10 s.t.
- Duration: 79% of neutral (faster)
- Prefer patterns: 5&A, A, EA
- Avoid patterns: 1&A and 3C

**Sadness:**
- Pitch level: 102 Hz
- Pitch range: 7 s.t.
- Duration: 129% of neutral (slower)
- Final lowering: yes
- Relative peak height: yes
- Prefer pattern: 3C
- Avoid pattern: 5&A

**Fear:**
- Pitch level: 200 Hz (highest)
- Pitch range: 8 s.t.
- Duration: 89% of neutral (slightly faster)
- Final lowering: yes
- Relative peak height: yes
- Prefer patterns: 12 and 3C
- Avoid patterns: A and EA

**Indignation:**
- Pitch level: 170 Hz
- Pitch range: 10 s.t.
- Duration: 117% of neutral (slightly slower)
- Final lowering: yes
- Prefer patterns: 12, but also 3C
- Avoid pattern: 1&A
- Durational proportion: stretch accented segments 40% more than unaccented

### Key Implementation Principle
Express variations in parameter values as deviations from neutrality, since speech synthesis systems typically produce neutral output.
