This paper investigates how listeners identify stop consonants, examining whether release bursts and formant transitions are invariant cues or context-dependent signals that vary with the following vowel. The key finding is that bursts and transitions are functionally equivalent, reciprocally weighted cues where burst effectiveness depends on spectral continuity with the vowel's front cavity resonance - labial bursts work best before back vowels, apical bursts before front vowels, and velar bursts vary with vowel F2. For speech synthesis, this reveals that both acoustic cues must be balanced contextually: burst spectrum should integrate naturally with vowel formants, and their relative perceptual weight can be traded off depending on VOT and vowel context.
