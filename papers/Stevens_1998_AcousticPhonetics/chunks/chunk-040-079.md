## Formant Data

No specific formant frequency data in this chunk. This section focuses on source mechanisms rather than vocal tract filtering.

## Rules/Algorithms

### Glottal Pulse Generation Algorithm
1. **Closed Phase**: Subglottal pressure builds, exerting lateral force on vocal folds
2. **Opening Phase**: Lower portions of folds begin to separate due to subglottal pressure
   - Upper edge remains closed initially
   - Lower mass follows sinusoidal trajectory (Eq. 2.2)
3. **Open Phase**:
   - Airflow begins through glottis
   - Upper edge separates with delay (phase lag) relative to lower edge
   - Airflow is roughly proportional to glottal area for constant pressure
4. **Closing Phase**:
   - Lower portions begin moving inward due to Bernoulli effect
   - Upper edge still moving outward when lower begins closing
   - Rapid closure creates abrupt airflow cessation
5. **Return Phase**: Upper edge closes, completing cycle

### Fundamental Frequency Control
- F0 primarily determined by vocal fold stiffness and mass
- Increasing stiffness (cricothyroid muscle contraction):
  - Increases natural frequency
  - Shortens glottal pulse duration
  - F0 changes of 20-30% achievable
- Lengthening vocal folds by 30%:
  - Increases mechanical stiffness by factor of ~3
  - Reduces mass per unit length by factor of ~0.7
  - Results in frequency increase by factor of ~2

### Alveolar Pressure Effects
- Increased alveolar pressure:
  - Increases force on lower vocal fold portions
  - Causes earlier separation of upper edges
  - Increases maximum glottal area proportional to P_alv
  - Volume velocity proportional to P_alv^(1/2)
  - Peak volume velocity proportional to P_alv^(3/2)
  - Low-frequency spectrum amplitude increases ~9 dB per doubling of P_alv

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The principal aim of this process is to create this abrupt cessation or abrupt reduction of the flow through some part of the glottis at a particular point in time in the cycle of vibration." (p. 57)

> "The source of excitation of the vocal tract is taken as the volume velocity Uo at the lips, then the transfer function of the vocal tract with volume velocity excitation Us at the glottis is given by Uo(omega)/Us(omega). This is an all-pole transfer function for nonnasalized vowels." (p. 67)

> "The output of ultimate interest is the sound pressure pr at some distance r from the mouth. This sound pressure is given approximately by pr(t) = (rho/4*pi*r) * dUo(t-r/c)/dt" (p. 67)

> "The waveform of this effective glottal excitation has two main features. One is the negative pulse with a rapid (negative) rise and an abrupt fall to zero. The rapid decrease to zero is sometimes called the return phase. This pulse is a consequence of the rapid closing of the glottis, as the lower portions of the vocal folds come together at a relatively high velocity enhanced by the effect of the acoustic mass of the airways." (p. 68)

> "At frequencies above 2 to 3 kHz, the spectrum amplitude rises to a broad peak that is a few decibels above this line. The spectrum amplitude of a component with frequency f in the range 1 to 2 kHz is determined by the maximum of Ug'(f), designated as Ug'dmax. The rms amplitude of this component is Ugd(f) = 2*Ug'dmax/(sqrt(2)*T0 * 2*pi*f)" (p. 72)

## Implementation Notes

For Klatt synthesizer implementation, the key parameters from this section:

1. **Open Quotient (OQ)**: Males ~0.54-0.57, Females ~0.64-0.71
   - Controls the fraction of the glottal cycle during which the glottis is open
   - Higher OQ = more breathy voice

2. **Source Spectrum Characteristics**:
   - Fundamental component dominates at low frequencies
   - -6 dB/octave slope above first formant region (~500 Hz)
   - Slight peak around 2.5 kHz region (few dB above the slope)
   - Male spectrum ~5 dB higher than female above 1 kHz

3. **Differentiated Waveform**:
   - Sound pressure is proportional to the derivative of glottal flow
   - Negative pulse with rapid rise and abrupt fall
   - This derivative is what excites the vocal tract

4. **F0 and Amplitude Coupling**:
   - Increased alveolar pressure increases both F0 and amplitude
   - Rate of F0 change: 3-5 Hz/cm change in alveolar pressure
   - Low-frequency amplitude increases ~9 dB per doubling of pressure

   - Minimum syllable duration: ~200 ms (stressed)

6. **Acoustic Mass Effects**:
   - Total acoustic mass: ~10*rho gm/cm^4 (from trachea + vocal tract)
   - Causes skewing of volume velocity waveform
   - Enhances high-frequency energy at closure

7. **Key Waveform Shape Parameters**:
   - Rising phase longer than falling phase (asymmetry)
   - Lower mass leads upper mass in phase
   - Rapid closure produces high-frequency energy
   - Gradual opening produces low-frequency dominance
