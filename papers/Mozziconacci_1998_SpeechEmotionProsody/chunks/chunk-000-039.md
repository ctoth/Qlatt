## Key Findings

### General
- Speech conveys more than just message content: speaker identity, gender, age, regional/social background, emotional state, attitude toward topic/listener
- Prosody conveys: word stress, phrasing, sentence structure, turn-taking, speaker identification, emotion/attitude
- Synthetic speech lacks variability that makes natural speech lively and engaging
- Key acoustic features affected by emotion: mean F0, signal amplitude, speech rate, pauses, breathiness, laryngealization

### Emotions Studied
Seven emotions were investigated:
1. Neutrality (reference)
2. Joy
3. Boredom
4. Anger
5. Sadness
6. Fear
7. Indignation

### Key Acoustic Parameters for Emotion
- **Pitch level**: How high or low the pitch is (mean F0, end frequency of declination baseline)
- **Pitch range**: Magnitude of F0 fluctuations (distance between F0 minima and maxima, excursion size in semitones)
- **Speech rate**: Relative utterance duration
- **Intonation patterns**: Sequences of pitch movements

### Prior Systems Mentioned
- **DECtalk3** "Affect Editor" (Cahn, 1990) - applies speech parameter values for emotion to synthesize sentences with "correct affect"
- **HAMLET system** (DecTalk synthesizer version 2.0) - communication prosthesis for disabled persons using parameter manipulations (Murray, 1989)
- Carlson, Granstrom, and Nord (1992) - overlaying pitch curves and sentence durations on natural utterances

## F0/Prosody Patterns

### Two-Component Intonation Model
The thesis uses the Dutch IPO intonation grammar ('t Hart, Collier, and Cohen, 1990):
- **Component 1 (Global/Declination)**: Slowly declining baseline representing pitch level
- **Component 2 (Local/Pitch movements)**: Fast pitch movements representing pitch range

### Pitch Movement Labels (Dutch IPO Grammar)
- **Rises**: 1 (early prominence-lending rise), 3 (late prominence-lending rise), 4, 5
- **Falls**: A (late prominence-lending fall), C, D, E
- Vertical lines in Figure 1 represent vowel onsets

### Intonation Patterns by Emotion
| Pattern | Emotions using it |
|---------|------------------|
| 15&A | neutrality, anger |
| 1D3C | joy, fear |
| 1D3&A / 1D1&A | boredom |
| 14E | sadness |
| 3C | fear |
| 45&A | indignation |

### Speech Rate Patterns
- **Faster than neutral**: anger (0.87-0.89x), joy (0.95-1.01x), fear (0.84-0.86x)
- **Slower than neutral**: boredom (1.33-1.55x), sadness (1.10-1.20x), indignation (1.18-1.33x)

### Pitch Level Patterns (End Frequency)
- **Low pitch**: neutrality (65 Hz), boredom (65 Hz)
- **Medium pitch**: sadness (95-110 Hz), anger (110 Hz)
- **High pitch**: joy (155 Hz), indignation (155-185 Hz), fear (200 Hz)

### Pitch Range Patterns (in semitones)
- **Small range (4-6 st)**: neutrality, boredom
- **Medium range (6-8 st)**: sadness, fear
- **Large range (10 st)**: joy, anger, indignation

## Voice Quality Parameters
- Mentioned: breathiness, laryngealization (creaky voice)
- Williams and Stevens (1972): fear and anger can provoke dryness of mouth, tremor in respiration
- Voice quality and pitch curves have independent effects on emotion expression (Ladd, Silverman, Tolkmitt, Bergman, and Scherer, 1985)

## Formant Data
No specific formant frequencies provided in this chunk.

## Klatt Synthesizer Details
Not directly mentioned in pages 0-39. However, the thesis uses:
- **LPC-coded diphone concatenation** for synthetic speech
- **TD-PSOLA algorithm** (Time-Domain Pitch-Synchronous OverLap-and-Add) for F0 manipulation (Charpentier and Moulines, 1989; Verhelst and Borger, 1991)

## Figures of Interest
- **Fig 1 (page 33/34):** Schematized graphical representation of intonation patterns with their labels
  - Shows 6 intonation contours (a-f) with pitch movement labels (1, 3, 4, 5, A, C, D, E)
  - Declination not represented; vertical lines = vowel onsets

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The acoustic features affected by emotion are mostly the mean F0, signal amplitude, pauses, breathiness, and laryngealization." (page 16, paraphrased)

> "Prosodic features such as intonation, tempo, rhythm, precision of articulation and voice quality" contain extra-linguistic information. (page 23)

> "The aspect of the speech signal providing the clearest indication of the emotional state of the speaker is the 'contour of F0 vs. time', i.e., the F0 curve; emotion appeared to modify the pitch-curve shape generated for a breath group in several ways." (page 25)

> "Cahn (1990) wrote that 'the acoustic features affected by emotion are mostly the mean F0 and duration correlates'" (page 25)

> "For neutral speech synthesized in Dutch, the end frequency is fixed at 75 Hz, and the size of the pitch movements is fixed at six semitones." (page 37)

> "The declination line (the tilted baseline on which the pitch movements are superimposed), was automatically computed on the basis of the end frequency and the duration of the utterance according to Cohen, Collier and 't Hart (1982)." (page 37)

## Implementation Notes

### F0 Contour Generation Procedure
1. Supply intonation pattern, number of pitch accents, and accent locations
2. Derive number of accents and vowel onset locations from actor's realizations
3. Generate synthetic F0 curves by varying:
   - End frequency of baseline (Hz) - determines pitch level
   - Excursion size of pitch movements (semitones) - determines pitch range
4. Three end frequency values tested: varying around original in 15 Hz steps
5. Three excursion sizes tested: 4, 6, 8 or 6, 8, 10 semitones
6. Transplant synthetic F0 curves onto original emotional utterances using TD-PSOLA

### Dutch IPO Standard Values for Neutral Speech
- End frequency: 75 Hz
- Pitch movement excursion: 6 semitones

### Database Details
- Recorded at IPO (Institute for Perception Research, Eindhoven)
- 936 speech samples total (3 speakers x 8 sentences x 13 emotions x 3 repetitions)
- Digitized at 10 kHz, 16-bit precision
- Subset of 315 utterances used (5 sentences x 7 emotions x 3 speakers x 3 times)

### Emotion Recognition Results (Table 2)
- Best recognized: neutrality (95%), boredom (95%), sadness (92.5%), indignation (87.5%)
- Moderate: joy (72.5%), fear (32.5% - often confused with indignation)
- Poorest: anger (42.5% - confused with joy)
