## Chapters/Sections Covered

This chunk covers:
1. **Commentary on Chapter 4** (pages 191-203) by Laura C. Dilley and Mara Breen - "Enduring Insights from over Forty Years of Traditional AM Theory"
2. **Author Response to the Commentary** (pages 204-211) by Sun-Ah Jun - "ToBI Is Not Designed to Be Phonetically Transparent"

These are part of an academic exchange about ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) annotation systems and the underlying AM (Autosegmental-Metrical) theory.

## Key Findings

### AM+ Theory (Enhanced AM) - Dilley & Breen's Proposal

1. **Five Tonal Levels**: AM+ proposes capturing five tonal levels using features [+/- same] and [+/- small]:
   - T_EH (Extra High): [-same, +higher, -small] = substantially higher than mean pitch
   - T_H (High): [-same, +higher, +small] = slightly higher than mean pitch
   - T_M (Mid): [+same] = equal to mean pitch
   - T_L (Low): [-same, -higher, +small] = slightly lower than mean pitch
   - T_EL (Extra Low): [-same, -higher, -small] = substantially lower than mean pitch

2. **Metrical Prominence Markers**:
   - **x** = moderate prominence
   - **X** = strong prominence
   - Starred tones (*) associate with metrically prominent syllables

3. **Strictly Monotonic Interpolation**: AM+ assumes interpolation functions between tones are strictly monotonic (all turning points are coded as tones)

4. **Timing Slots**: Every tone must be associated with a timing slot - disallows floating tones and multiple associations between tone and timing slot

### RaP (Rhythm and Pitch) System

1. **Pitch Tier Symbols** for syntagmatic relationships between adjacent tones:
   - **H**: [-same, +higher] - tone higher than previous
   - **!H**: [-same, +higher, +small] - tone slightly higher (small rise)
   - **E**: [+same] - tone equal to previous
   - **!L**: [-same, -higher, +small] - tone slightly lower
   - **L**: [-same, -higher] - tone lower than previous

2. **Phrase-Initial Symbols** (3 types):
   - **:L H** (omitting + and *) = rise
   - **:H L** = fall
   - **:E E** = level pitch

3. **Phrase-Final Symbols** (variable number of unstarred tones):
   - Final rises treated as two unstarred tones (**H H** %)
   - Monotonic rise = only one tone (**H** %)

4. **Slope Changes**: RaP codifies vertices (slope changes) as tones using:
   - **>** for upper edge of pitch range
   - **<** for lower edge of pitch range

### ToBI vs MAE_ToBI

- MAE_ToBI (Mainstream American English ToBI) is a specific implementation
- Not all criticisms of MAE_ToBI apply to ToBI* generally
- Language-specific ToBI systems may modify MAE_ToBI principles

### Syntagmatic Tonal Relationships

- **Downstep**: L+H* followed by another H* results in lowered second H*
- **Upstep**: Phenomenon where tones step up
- **Downdrift**: Global pitch declination
- **Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP)**: Captures restriction that tones tend not to repeat

## Parameters Found

### F0 Modeling Parameters

1. **Pitch Targets**: Associated with timing slots specifying locations of change in velocity of pitch change over time
   - f'(x) = 0 for F0 maxima/minima (smoothed F0 contour)
   - f''(x) = 0 for slope changes (elbows, steepness changes)

2. **Speaker Pitch Range**:
   - Reference level *r* = [+same], speaker's habitual/mean pitch
   - F0 is treated as a low-bandwidth channel (Shannon 1948)
   - Paradigmatic tonal contrasts are limited in number

3. **Tonal Height Features**:
   - [+/- same]: whether tone equals reference
   - [+/- higher]: whether tone is above/below reference
   - [+/- small]: magnitude of pitch difference (small vs large)

### Prominence Levels

- RaP distinguishes THREE levels of syllable prominence:
  1. Metrically nonprominent (no pitch accent, flat pitch)
  2. Metrically prominent without pitch accent (flat pitch)
  3. Metrically prominent with pitch accent (pitch change)

- ToBI distinguishes only TWO: pitch accent or no pitch accent

## Rules/Algorithms

### Pitch Accent Assignment

1. **Starred tones (*)** associate with metrically prominent syllables
2. **Unstarred tones (+)** associate with:
   - Nonprominent slots adjacent to starred tones
   - Constituent edges (phrase boundaries)

### RaP Transcription Rules

1. **L+H*** in RaP: Sequence of two tones with space = ToBI*'s L+H*
2. **L* + H** in RaP: + on left side of starred tone = ToBI*'s L*+H
3. Phrase-initial tone phonological status determined by following tone (via reciprocal property)

### Interpolation Between Tones

- Tones separated by multiple syllables/words connected via interpolations
- Interpolation functions must be strictly monotonic
- All F0 turning points are coded as tones (not interpolation artifacts)

### Greek Prenuclear Accents (Example)

- Characterized as **L+ !H* +H** in RaP
- F0 valley precedes accented syllable
- Peak follows accented syllable
- Predicts observed slope change

## Figures of Interest

- **Table 4c.1** (page 191): Five-level paradigmatic tone specifications
  - Shows mapping from lexical specification to phonetic interpretation
  - Demonstrates how [+/- same], [+/- higher], [+/- small] combine

## Quotes Worth Preserving

1. On F0 as bandwidth-limited: "F0 is a low-bandwidth channel" - limits paradigmatic tonal contrasts

2. On pitch perception: "Frequency ratios do not need to be exact to be heard as instances of a musical category" (Siegel and Siegel 1977)

3. On ToBI's purpose: "ToBI was designed to be a phonological transcription system, using L and H tonal symbols that capture contrastive tonal events marking either prominence relationships among words or the metrical and prosodic structure of an utterance"

4. On phonetic transparency: "The goal of a ToBI transcription is not to recover surface F0 contours like a close copy, but to represent and analyze contours in terms of contrastive tonal categories"

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Five-Level Pitch System**: Consider implementing 5 pitch targets (EH, H, M, L, EL) rather than binary H/L
   - More natural pitch variation
   - Captures small vs large pitch movements

2. **Pitch Target Timing**:
   - Targets correspond to f''(x) = 0 points (acceleration = 0)
   - F0 maxima/minima at f'(x) = 0
   - Smooth interpolation between targets

3. **Syntagmatic Features**: Track relationship between adjacent tones
   - [+/- same]: is this tone at same level as previous?
   - [+/- higher]: direction of change
   - [+/- small]: magnitude of change

4. **Prominence-Pitch Interaction**:
   - Pitch range varies with prominence (expanded for stressed, compressed for unstressed)
   - Duration and intensity also signal prominence (not just F0)

5. **Phrase-Level Effects**:
   - Pitch-range reset at phrase boundaries
   - Phrase-final lengthening
   - Boundary tones for phrase edges

### RaP-Inspired Prosody Model

Consider a hybrid approach:
- **Rhythm tier**: Mark prominence levels (x, X, or unmarked)
- **Pitch tier**: Mark relative pitch changes (H, !H, E, !L, L)
- **+ symbol**: Associate unstarred tones with adjacent starred tones

### Downstep/Upstep Implementation

- After H*+L or L+H*, subsequent H* should be realized lower (downstep)
- Track "register" that can shift down throughout utterance
- Reset register at major phrase boundaries

### Key Insight for Synthesis

ToBI is phonological (abstract categories), not phonetic (surface F0). For synthesis:
- Need mapping from ToBI labels to actual F0 values
- This mapping depends on speaker pitch range, prominence, phrase position
- Consider using RaP-style relative specifications for more natural variation
