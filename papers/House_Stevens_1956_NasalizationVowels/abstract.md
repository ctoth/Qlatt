# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

In a recent discussion of phonology, Hockett (14) introduces the topic of nasalization by saying, "The acoustic correlates of nasalization are not so clear." A review of the literature dealing with nasalization and nasality seems to bear out Hockett's contention. The literature is sparse enough for Moser, Dreher and Adler (18) to review in a few short paragraphs. They conclude that there is general agreement that 'extra resonances' are added to the vowel spectrum when nasality is perceived but the location of the additional resonances is undecided, and that some disagreement exists regarding the effect of nasality on the overall level of the signal.

From the point of view of articulation, the picture is a little clearer but is not unequivocal. Many students of speech production agree that the articulatory feature most characteristic of nasality involves the coupling of the nasopharynx to the vocal tract proper by appropriate manipulations of the velopharyngeal musculature.

## Our Interpretation

This paper investigates the acoustic and perceptual characteristics of nasalized vowels using electrical analogs of the vocal and nasal tracts. The key finding is that nasal coupling primarily reduces the amplitude of the first formant and shifts its frequency upward, with secondary effects on higher formants, and these physical changes are correlated with human perception of nasality. This work is highly relevant for formant synthesis because it provides empirical measurements of how nasalization modifies vowel spectra, enabling synthetic nasalized vowels to be produced with accurate acoustic and perceptual characteristics.
