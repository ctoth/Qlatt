# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The research reported in this thesis has two distinct and interrelated parts. The first part is directed towards the development of a highly interactive computer facility where controlled studies of the acoustic characteristics of selected consonants, consonant clusters, and vowels in prescribed phonetic environments can be carried out. In conjunction with the development of the data-base facility, a large corpus of acoustic data has been collected. The format of the data is a nonsense utterance embedded in a carrier sentence "Say ___ again", where the consonants and vowels are systematically varied. 61 vowels and diphthongs were used to form the syllabic nuclei and 51 word-initial consonants and consonant clusters were included.

The second half of the thesis utilizes the collected data and the developed facility to study the acoustic characteristics of English stops, both in singleton and in clusters. The data included 1,728 utterances spoken by 4 male speakers of various aspects of the temporal and spectral characteristics of these stops were quantified and discussed in detail. The findings in general suggest the presence of context independent acoustic properties for these stops. The exact nature of the acoustic invariance, however, still remains a topic of further investigation.

## Our Interpretation

This thesis establishes the foundational database and methodology for systematically measuring how stop consonants vary acoustically across vowel contexts. Zue collected 1,728 utterances and quantified voice onset time (VOT), burst frequency, and burst amplitude patterns, revealing that while stops show some context-independent acoustic properties, their acoustic characteristics—particularly burst frequency and amplitude—still vary significantly with following vowel context. This work is critical for speech synthesis because it provides the empirical measurements and systematic analysis framework needed to implement natural-sounding stop consonants in formant synthesizers, establishing precise targets for burst spectra, timing, and vowel-dependent modifications.
