This paper provides a comprehensive acoustic-perceptual analysis of seven distinct voice qualities (modal, tense, breathy, whispery, creaky, harsh, and lax-creaky) and their relationship to emotional expression through KLSYN88 synthesis and perceptual evaluation. The key contribution is a complete set of glottal source parameter trajectories for each voice quality, demonstrating that voice quality primarily signals arousal/activation states rather than emotional valence, with tense/harsh voices indicating high activation and breathy/lax voices indicating low activation. This work is critical for speech synthesis because it provides empirically-validated parameter mappings that enable realistic emotional expression through voice quality manipulation without requiring f0 dynamics alone.
