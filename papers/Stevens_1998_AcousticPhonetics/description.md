This comprehensive 607-page textbook by Kenneth N. Stevens establishes the quantitative relationship between articulatory movements, acoustic transfer functions, and voice source mechanisms for all major speech sound classes, providing theoretical foundations for understanding how speakers produce different phonemes. The work details precise measurements and equations for glottal flow derivatives, vocal tract resonances, formant frequencies and bandwidths, source-filter interactions, and acoustic landmarks for vowels, stops, fricatives, nasals, and liquids, grounded in extensive experimental data from Peterson & Barney and Klatt's work. For speech synthesis, Stevens provides the critical acoustic parameters and timing rules needed to generate natural-sounding speech by specifying formant targets, bandwidth adjustments, noise characteristics, and coarticulation windows for each phoneme class.
