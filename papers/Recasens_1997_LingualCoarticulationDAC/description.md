This paper introduces the Degree of Articulatory Constraint (DAC) model, which quantifies how much coarticulation individual phonemes can exert or resist based on their tongue-dorsum involvement in production. The key finding is that coarticulation magnitude and direction depend on the DAC values of consonants and vowels—with maximal coarticulation occurring when gestures are antagonistic (e.g., dark /l/ pulling the tongue back while /i/ pulls it forward), and directionality varying by consonant class (dorsals show carryover, dark /l/ shows anticipation, alveolars context-dependent). For speech synthesis, the DAC model enables precise formant transition modeling by predicting coarticulation size, temporal extent, and direction from segment properties alone, making it directly applicable to implementing natural vowel undershoot and consonant-dependent formant trajectories.
