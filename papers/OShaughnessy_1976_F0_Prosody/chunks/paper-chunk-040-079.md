## Key Findings

### F0 Accent Patterns (M-H-L)

The archetype F0 accent obtrusion forms a basis of later analysis in this thesis. The basic F0 pattern for marking accent is described as an **M-H-L pattern** (Middle-High-Low), or a local increase in F0 above a declination line. This fundamental pattern is used throughout the analysis.

Key observations:
- Primary stress correlates with change from highest to lowest intonation level
- F0 contour on a stressed word goes from middle to high to low (M-H-L) levels in sequence
- "Unstressedness" is shown by F0 falling to and remaining in the bottom range
- "Stressedness" is shown by increasing or holding up the F0

### Prominence-Lending F0 Movements

Collier's "rules of thumb" for prominence-lending F0 movements (p. 44):
- **Abrupt rise** in F0 utilizes "a 25 to 35% Fo-increase every 100 msec"
- **Abrupt fall** is steeper, with a "40 to 50% Fo-decrease every 100 msec"
- Pitch falls are less effective in making a syllable prominent than rises

### Stress Marking Mechanics

- Stressed syllable is always marked by higher F0 than adjacent unstressed syllable
- The transition between high and low F0 occurs within the syllable, or F0 jumps up to or down from it
- Sloping F0 was more effective than step change in F0 for marking stress
- Rises were more effective than falls for stress perception
- Morton & Jassem found 25% and 58% changes in F0 were equally effective in marking stress (all-or-none effect)

### Perceptually Relevant Pitch Movements (PRPMs)

't Hart, Cohen, and Collier's Dutch research postulated three classes of F0 phenomena:
1. **'Major' F0 movements** - from the speaker's commands (referred to as 'high level' F0 effects)
2. **'Minor' F0 movements** - from the speaker's commands
3. **'Micro' F0 patterns** - solely a consequence of physically determined factors ('low level' F0 effects)

In the 'major' class they put the F0 pattern of **"declination line"** - "a gradual fall-off" in F0 of about **3% every 100 msec** (p. 47), which formed "an average reference voice level" as "a way of relating up or down excursions" to such a baseline F0.

### Types of PRPMs Identified

They distinguished several types of PRPMs (p. 49):
- **2 types of declination line** (high and low)
- **2 rises**:
  - Rise "1" - prominence-lending, occurring early in the syllable
  - Rise "2" - non-prominence-lending, occurring at end of utterance
- **3 falls**:
  - Fall "A" - prominent, late in the syllable
  - Fall "B" - non-prominent, occurring before or early in the syllable (but falling not as far as the prominent one)
  - Fall "D" - gradual fall which "extends itself over all syllables between two prominence-giving rises"

The gradual fall D likely corresponds with the exponential fall-off that frequently occurs in English F0 patterns after an F0 peak.

### Timing of Rises and Falls for Prominence

Van Katwijk suggests (p. 50):
- A **rise should start at ca 50 msec before the onset of the vowel** to lend prominence
- A **fall "ca 50 msec after the vowel onset"** to lend prominence
- Rises are more effective in lending prominence than falls
- The position of the **peak** of an F0 rise is more relevant for prominence than the onset of the rise
- Longer rises have later peaks (relative to the vowel onset)

### The "Hat" Pattern

For Dutch, the essential pattern is the **"hat" pattern**: upon a low declination line is superimposed a Rise 1, a period of high declination, and then a Fall A (p. 51). In one-accent utterances, the two pitch movements fall on the same syllable, while with two, "the rise is situated on the first and the fall on the second."

### Contrastive Stress (CS)

Contrastive stress involves:
- Larger than usual amount of F0 accent
- Longer durations
- Louder syllables
- Used to discriminate among a small number of alternatives or contradict an assumption

Phonetic correlates:
- Heightened F0 on the prominent syllable
- F0 for the rest of the contour is lower than in a similar sentence without emphasis
- The Fo slope on a syllable with CS increases (Cohen & 't Hart, 1967:190)

### Normal Intonation Rules

- In 'normal' intonation, 'focus' or 'main stress' usually falls on the **last accented word** according to rules like the Nuclear Stress Rule (NSR)
- English tends to shift the major stress toward the end of the sentence
- The main accent goes "normally, on 'the last stressable constituent'"
- It is essentially the **unpredictability of a word in context** that gauges its accent (and hence stress)
- Semantic factors are as clearly important as syntax

### F0 Control Mechanisms

Two main factors for F0 variation:
1. **Subglottal pressure (Psub)**
2. **Laryngeal muscle tension**

Muscle activity is the main factor in F0 variation, with Psub in a secondary role.

### F0 Production Constraints

- Fo rises require more effort than falls
- Fo lowering is faster than raising
- Accelerator and decelerator muscles may be involved
- Rising intervals have slower response time values than falling intervals
- Pitch lowering tends to be faster than pitch raising for a comparable pitch interval

### F0 Patterns Described by Linear Segments

Takefuta found F0 contours could be described in terms of "pitch patterns" each consisting of a succession of 2 or 3 "fundamental pattern features":
- "fast rising"
- "rising"
- "level"
- "falling"

The combined information of pitch pattern and pitch level measured in **8 contrastive units** comprise the primary phonetic signal of intonation perceived by American listeners (1970:882).

### Duration-F0 Relationship

- A syllable with more F0 movement will have longer duration
- "A pitch obtrusion requires time for its execution"
- When the pitch accent is embraced completely by a single syllable, the syllable is lengthened to accommodate the necessary range of pitches
- Accented syllables are normally longer than unaccented ones in comparable positions within the utterance
- Syllables which have large F0 rises show "marked lengthening"
- F0 peaks show positive correlation with the length of the associated stressed vowel

## Rules/Algorithms

### F0 Accent Detection (Lea & Kloker's System)
1. Look for a section of speech "with nonfalling (or at least not-very-rapidly-falling) Fo"
2. Threshold: "no more than 2 eighth tones [= 1/2 semitone] per" 50 msec (1975:15)
3. Detect rises above this baseline as stressed syllables

### F0 Contour Linearization Method (O'Shaughnessy)
1. Obtain Fo values every 10 msec using hardware extraction (Gold & Rabiner 1969 algorithm)
2. Ignore F0 during unvoiced portions of speech (no vocal cord vibration)
3. Represent each rising or falling F0 movement as a straight line by connecting endpoints of each F0 excursion
4. Ignore F0 in low-energy regions (defined as having amplitude below 40% of the maximum on that syllable) of any voiced consonants adjacent to the vocalic nuclei
5. Ignore certain F0 points at the beginning and end of a voiced segment
6. Eliminate sudden oscillations (jumps of more than 8 Hz/centisecond) at boundaries of voiced segments
7. Ignore large rate changes (such as 6 Hz/cs) if they are contained within the smooth contour of a vowel or sonorant (these occasionally mark accent)
8. Fit remaining smooth contours of F0 during sonorants with straight lines (by hand)

### F0 Accent Components
F0 accent consists of at least 2 components (Fig. 3):
1. A prior **jump** or **upstep** in F0 before the accented syllabic nucleus
2. A **rise** in F0 during the nucleus itself

Terminology:
- **'jump'** and **'drop'** refer to positive and negative inter-nucleus F0 changes
- **'rise'** and **'fall'** denote nuclear changes (+ for rise/jump, - for fall/drop)
- **'Rise accent'** (or simply 'accent') = sum of the prior jump and ensuing F0 rise in an accented syllable (AS)
- **'Fall accent'** (or 'descent') = sum of the F0 fall on the AS after the F0 peak and the ensuing drop to the start of the next syllabic nucleus
- For an unaccented syllable (US), **'prior descent'** = the F0 descent to the start of its nucleus

### F0 Pattern Notation
The F0 pattern on a syllable is abbreviated in the form:
`'(a,b,c,d) e (f,g,..)'`

Where:
- a-d and f-g are signed numbers representing sequential F0 changes
- Each parenthesized group represents F0 changes over one syllable
- 'a' and 'f' note the jump or drop in F0 from end of prior nucleus to start of current nucleus
- 'b', 'c', 'd' note successive rises or falls within that nucleus
- 'e' notes the F0 peak attained within the nucleus

## Figures of Interest

- **Fig. 3** (referenced p. 72): Shows F0 accent consisting of at least 2 components - a prior jump/upstep and a rise during the nucleus

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Fo provides the main acoustic correlate to intonation and stress. Although there is a trading relationship among Fo, duration, and amplitude, increases, step changes, and rapid falls in Fo have stronger effects than duration or amplitude in marking a syllable as accented" (p. 45-46)

> "the primary acoustic cue of prominence" is "a sharp fall in Fo immediately following the stressed syllable" or "on the end of the prominent syllable" (p. 43)

> "A pitch obtrusion requires time for its execution. When the pitch accent is embraced completely by a single syllable, the syllable is lengthened to accommodate the necessary range of pitches" (p. 66)

> "the slopes of rise and fall do not play a decisive part in the pattern. It is rather the location of these movements that is highly critical" ('t Hart, 1967:188)

> "Since the tolerance is rather large with respect to excursion and duration, the most relevant perceptual difference is one between 'abrupt' rises and falls (62), with abrupt changes occurring within one syllable and smooth ones over several (63)." (p. 50)

> "the Fo trajectory on virtually all syllables can be closely approximated by 1-3 linear segments" (p. 73)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Basic accent pattern**: Implement the M-H-L pattern for stressed syllables - F0 rises before/into the stressed syllable and falls after it.

2. **Timing parameters**:
   - Start F0 rise ~50 msec before vowel onset for prominence
   - F0 fall should begin ~50 msec after vowel onset
   - Abrupt rises: 25-35% F0 increase per 100 msec
   - Abrupt falls: 40-50% F0 decrease per 100 msec (steeper than rises)

3. **Declination line**: Implement a baseline that falls at approximately 3% per 100 msec over the course of an utterance.

4. **Linear approximation**: F0 contours can be effectively represented by 1-3 linear segments per syllable. This simplifies implementation while preserving perceptual quality.

5. **Duration interaction**: Lengthen syllables that have large F0 excursions to allow time for the pitch change.

6. **Contrastive stress**: Implement by:
   - Raising F0 peak higher on the emphasized syllable
   - Lowering F0 on the rest of the contour
   - Increasing the F0 slope on that syllable

7. **Normal vs. emphatic**: In normal intonation without special context, place main accent on the last content word. For contrastive stress, any word (including function words) can receive the accent.

8. **"Hat" pattern for phrases**: For a phrase with accents, superimpose a rise on the first accented syllable, maintain high F0, then fall on the last accented syllable - creating a "hat" shape.

9. **Fine-grain variation ignorable**: Variation of 1-3 Hz per pitch period and minor inflections in falling F0 shapes can be ignored without affecting the communication of linguistic information - only the overall rise/level/fall pattern matters.

10. **Binary stress sufficient**: Only a binary distinction (+ Prominence) vs. unstressed is needed; fine control of exact F0 values is not necessary as long as the direction of change (rising vs. falling) is correct.
