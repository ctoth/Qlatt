KLATTSTAT demonstrates automatic extraction of all 40 Klatt formant synthesizer parameters from natural speech signals and their integration into a statistical parametric speech synthesis framework, bridging classical knowledge-based synthesis with modern machine learning approaches. The paper achieves completely intelligible TTS output by training CART decision trees on extracted Klatt parameters (including GMM-based detection of articulatory features like nasality, aspiration, and frication) and predicting these parameters from text at synthesis time. This work is significant for speech synthesis because it proves that knowledge-based Klatt parameters are both automatically extractable and predictable, enabling interpretable parameter manipulation for style and voice quality control while establishing Klatt's viability as an alternative to spectral parameterizations like MCEPs.
