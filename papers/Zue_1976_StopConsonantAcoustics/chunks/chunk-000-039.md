## Key Findings

### Thesis Goals (from Abstract)
- **Part 1:** Development of interactive computer facility for controlled acoustic studies of consonants, consonant clusters, and vowels
- **Part 2:** Study of acoustic characteristics of English stops in singleton and clusters
- Data includes **1,728 utterances** spoken by **3 male speakers**
- Findings suggest presence of **context-independent acoustic properties** for stops
- Key acoustic cues studied: temporal and spectral characteristics

### Important Acoustic Concepts

1. **Voice Onset Time (VOT)** is a critical parameter:
   - Not only basis for separating voicing categories
   - Also sensitive to **place of stop closure**
   - Lisker & Abramson (1964) showed VOT captures voicing, aspiration, and force of articulation

2. **Burst frequency** and **formant transitions** are two major cues for stop identity (per Haskins Laboratory work - Cooper et al. 1952, Delattre et al. 1954)

3. **Acoustic loci** concept: Different formant loci associated with place and manner of articulation

4. **Coarticulation effects:**
   - Acoustic correlates of features depend on presence/absence of other features
   - Vowel formants are modified by consonant context (Fig 1.1: "boo" vs "do")
   - Stop characteristics vary by phonetic environment (Fig 1.2: "tea", "steep", "tree")

### Data Collection Design

- **Format:** Nonsense word "haCVC embedded in carrier sentence "Say ___ again"
- **Phonetic scope:** Prestressed consonants and consonant clusters
- **Vowels studied:** 15 vowels and diphthongs (Table 2.I page 28)
- **Consonants studied:** All word-initial consonants and clusters in English

### Table 2.I: Consonants, Clusters, and Vowels Used

**Singleton Consonants:**
p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, s, z, f, v, l, r, w, y, theta, eth, sh, zh

**2-Element Clusters:**
pl, pr, tr, tw, kl, kr, kw, bl, br, dr, dw, gl, gr, gw, fl, fr, sp, st, sk, sm, sn, sl, sw, shr, thr

**3-Element Clusters:**
spr, spl, str, skr

**Vowels:**
i, I, e, epsilon, ae, a, open-o, o, O, u, U, schwa, oy, ay, aw

### Recording Methodology
- Sound-proof room, >50 dB signal-to-noise ratio
- Altec 684B microphone with Presto model 800 tape recorder
- Speaking rate: ~5 syllables/second
- Multiple speakers and sessions to account for inter/intra-speaker variability

## Equations Found

### Linear Prediction Model (Section 3.1.1)

The speech production model difference equation:

$$s(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{p} a(k)s(n-k) + x(n) \quad \text{[3.1]}$$

where $s(n)$ and $x(n)$ are the n-th samples of output speech wave and excitation.

Predicted value:
$$\hat{s}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{p} a(k)s(n-k) \quad \text{[3.2]}$$

Mean-squared error minimization:
$$E = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} [s(n) - \hat{s}(n)]^2 \quad \text{[3.3]}$$

Covariance formulation:
$$\sum_{k=1}^{p} a(k)\phi(i,k) = \phi(i,0) \quad i=1,2,...,p \quad \text{[3.4]}$$

where:
$$\phi(i,j) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} s(n-i)s(n-j) \quad i,j=1,2,...,p \quad \text{[3.5]}$$

Autocorrelation formulation (Toeplitz form):
$$\phi(i,j) = \phi(|i-j|,0) \quad \text{[3.10]}$$

Inverse filter impulse response:
$$h(n) = \begin{cases} 1/a(0) & n=0 \\ -a(n)/a(0) & n=1,2,...,p \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \quad \text{[3.11]}$$

### All-Pole Transfer Function (Figure 3.1)

$$H(z) = \frac{1}{1 - \sum_{k=1}^{p} a_k z^{-k}}$$

## Figures of Interest

- **Figure 1.1 (page 15):** Spectrograms of "boo" and "do" - shows formant frequencies of the vowel are modified by the consonant
- **Figure 1.2 (page 16):** Spectrograms of "tea", "steep", and "tree" - shows spectral and temporal characteristics of /t/ release modified by phonetic environment
- **Figure 1.3 (page 18):** Spectrogram of "multiply the numbers and display the result" - example of schwa deletion (phonological effect)
- **Figure 3.1 (page 35):** All-pole model of speech production - shows voiced (periodic impulse train) vs unvoiced (random noise) excitation through H(z) filter

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesis

1. **VOT is critical for stop perception:**
   - Must accurately model VOT differences between voiced/voiceless stops
   - VOT also varies by place of articulation

2. **Coarticulation modeling is essential:**
   - Stop acoustic properties vary significantly by vowel context
   - Formant transitions must be context-dependent

3. **Burst characteristics matter:**
   - Burst frequency location is a cue to place of articulation
   - Must model burst spectra differently for /p,t,k,b,d,g/

4. **Linear prediction analysis provides formant data:**
   - The all-pole model (Figure 3.1) is essentially what Klatt's cascade branch implements
   - Predictor coefficients can be converted to formant frequencies/bandwidths

5. **Study focuses on prestressed CV syllables** - this is the clearest acoustic environment for stops

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The purpose of this thesis is to probe further into this relationship for a subset of the English speech sounds, namely the stop consonants. The study is carried out under a controlled linguistic environment, using a data-base facility designed for acoustic phonetic research." (page 10)

> "It was decided at the outset that this study would be directed primarily towards prestressed consonants and consonant clusters... Acoustic invariants are more likely to be observed in such an environment." (page 24)

> "The major finding of this study is that the features of voicing, aspiration and force of articulation could be plausible consequences of a single variable -- voice-onset time (VOT). VOT was found to be not only a basis for separating the voicing categories, but also sensitive to the place of stop closure." (page 21)

> "Their major finding has been that burst frequency as well as direction and degree of formant transitions are perceptually important cues to the identification of the stop consonants." (page 20)

> "In any study of the acoustic properties of speech sounds, the influence of the phonetic environment must be taken into account." (page 14)
