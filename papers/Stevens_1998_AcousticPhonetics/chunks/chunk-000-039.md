## Key Findings

### Speech Production System Overview
- Speech production system divided into three parts: (1) system below larynx, (2) larynx and surrounding structures, (3) structures above larynx
- The glottis (constricted region at vocal folds) is just a few millimeters long and forms the dividing line between subglottal and supraglottal systems
- For most speech sounds, subglottal system provides energy in the airflow; laryngeal and supraglottal structures modulate this airflow to produce audible sound
- Sound sources can be organized into discrete linguistic categories or features stored in speaker/listener memory

### Subglottal System
- Trachea: cross-sectional area ~2.5 cm^2, length 10-12 cm for adults
- Vital capacity: 3000-5000 cm^3 in adults
- Normal breathing: lung volume excursions usually less than 1000 cm^3
- Speech production: lungs expanded above resting state, using 10-20% of vital capacity (500-1000 cm^3)
- Lung pressure during speech: maintained at 5-10 cm H2O, variation no more than 30% from maximum to minimum

### Vocal Folds
- Length: ~1.5 cm for males, ~1.0 cm for females
- Cartilaginous portion: ~0.3 cm at posterior end
- Total thickness: 2-3 mm
- Cover thickness: ~0.4 mm for females, ~0.5 mm for males at midpoint
- Body: vocalis muscle, diameter ~2 mm
- Natural frequency (mass-spring system): f = 1/(2pi*sqrt(MC))
  - Female: ~200 Hz
  - Male: ~120 Hz

### Vocal Fold Damping (Q factor)
- Resonant frequency ~100 Hz: Q of about 4
- At 200 Hz: Q of about 7
- Effective resistance per unit length:
  - Male: ~8 dyne-s/cm^2
  - Female: ~4 dyne-s/cm^2

### Vocal Tract Dimensions (Table 1.1)
| Measurement | Adult Female | Adult Male |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Vocal tract length | 14.1 cm | 16.9 cm |
| Pharynx length | 6.3 cm | 8.9 cm |
| Oral cavity length | 7.8 cm | 8.1 cm |

### Vocal Tract Cross-sectional Areas
- Pharyngeal region for /a/: ~0.60 cm^2
- Pharyngeal region for /i/: ~7.6 cm^2
- Oral region for low vowel: 4-5 cm^2
- Oral region for high vowel: 0.7-1.1 cm^2
- Area-dimension relationship: A = Kd^alpha (where alpha ~2.0 for oral region, ~0.9 for pharyngeal)

### Soft Palate/Velum
- Size: ~4 cm long, ~2 cm wide, ~0.5 cm thick
- Velopharyngeal opening: ~1.0 cm^2 or more when completely lowered
- Nasal sound opening: 0.2-0.8 cm^2

### Nasal Cavity
- Total length: ~11 cm from posterior to anterior end
- Total volume: ~25 cm^3
- Narrowest portion: at nostrils, cross-sectional area 1-2 cm^2
- Sinus volumes: maxillary sinuses 10-20 cm^3 each, frontal/sphenoidal 3-10 cm^3 each

### Lip Opening
- Width (dimension A): 45 mm down to ~10 mm depending on vowel
- Height (dimension B): 20 mm down to ~5 mm depending on vowel
- Cross-sectional area: 0.3-7 cm^2 for different vowels
- Effective length/area ratio: 0.2 cm^-1 (lowered mandible, nonprotruded lips) to 6.0 cm^-1 (raised mandible, protruded lips)

## Equations Found

### Young's Modulus (vocal fold stiffness)
$$Y = \frac{\Delta F/A}{\Delta x/x}$$
- Units: dynes per square centimeter
- Where: Delta F is force change, A is area, Delta x is displacement, x is original dimension

### Mechanical Impedance (vocal tract walls)
$$Z_s = 1/j\omega C_s + j\omega M_s + R_s$$
- Valid for frequencies up to 100-200 Hz
- Typical values:
  - C_s: 1.0 x 10^-5 to 3.0 x 10^-5 cm^5/dyne
  - M_s: 1.0 to 2.0 gm/cm^2
  - R_s: 800 to 2000 dyne-s/cm^3
- Resonant frequency of surface tissue: 30-40 Hz

### Laminar Flow Pressure Drop (circular tube)
$$\frac{\Delta P}{L} = \frac{128\mu U}{\pi D^4}$$

### Laminar Flow Pressure Drop (rectangular tube)
$$\frac{\Delta P}{L} = \frac{12\mu U}{ba^3}$$
- Where a << b, a is narrower dimension

### Reynolds Number
$$Re = \frac{Vh\rho}{\mu}$$
- Critical Reynolds number for smooth tubes: ~2000
- Critical Reynolds number for rough surfaces: ~2000

### Turbulent Flow Pressure Drop
$$\frac{\Delta P}{L} = \frac{k}{D}\left(\frac{\rho V^2}{2}\right)$$
- k ranges from 0.02 to 0.08 depending on wall roughness

### Bernoulli Pressure (constriction)
$$P_1 + \frac{\rho V_1^2}{2} = P_2 + \frac{\rho V_2^2}{2}$$
- Simplified: P_2 - P_1 = -rho*V_2^2/2 when V_1 << V_2

### Pressure Drop at Contraction/Expansion
$$\Delta P = k_L \frac{\rho V_2^2}{2}$$
- k_L range: 0.05 (smooth transition) to 1.0 (abrupt expansion)
- Total k_L for constrictions: 1.2-1.7 typical

### Airflow-Area-Pressure Relation
$$\Delta P = 1.0\frac{\rho U^2}{2A^2}$$
- Where U is volume velocity, A is cross-sectional area

## Formant Data
(Chapter 1 focuses on anatomy/physiology; formant data appears in later chapters)

## Rules/Algorithms

### Cross-sectional Area Estimation
1. For pharyngeal region: A = Kd^alpha where alpha ~0.9
   - K varies 1.1-1.5 depending on location
   - d is midsagittal cross-dimension in cm
   - A is in cm^2

2. For oral region: A = Kd^alpha where alpha ~2.0
   - K varies 1.0-2.0 depending on speaker

### Airflow Classification by Constriction Size
- Vowels: constriction area 0.2-3 cm^2
- Fricatives: constriction area 0.05-0.2 cm^2
- Aspiration: constriction area 0.1-0.4 cm^2 (glottal)

### Voicing Conditions
- Normal voicing: airflow 200-500 cm^3/s, pressure 3-8 cm H2O
- Breathy voicing: airflow up to 1500 cm^3/s
- For voicing to occur:
  1. Subglottal pressure > supraglottal pressure
  2. Transglottal pressure drop sufficient to overcome vocal fold stiffness
  3. Glottal area during closure phase small enough

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The aim of the book is to present a theory of speech sound generation in the human vocal system. The acoustic aspects of this theory are grounded in a representation of speech sound production as the creation of sound sources in the vocal tract and the filtering of these sources by the vocal tract airways." (Preface, p. vii)

> "The theme of this book is to explore these relations between the discrete linguistic features and their articulatory and acoustic manifestations." (Preface, p. vii)

> "For a linear mass-spring system with mechanical compliance C and mass M, the natural frequency is given by f = 1/(2*pi*sqrt(MC))." (p. 12)

> "The average airflow for voiced vowel sounds produced by adult male speakers is about 200 cm^3/s and for adult females is about 140 cm^3/s." (p. 33)

> "The peak glottal airflow for normal glottal vibration is in the range 200 to 700 cm^3/s." (p. 35)

> "For modal voicing, the peak glottal area during the vibratory cycle is usually between 0.05 and 0.2 cm^2 for an adult, corresponding to a width of the glottal opening of about 0.5 to 2.0 mm, if the length of the glottis is taken to be 1.0 cm." (p. 35)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Vocal Tract Length Scaling**
   - Female vocal tract ~14.1 cm, male ~16.9 cm
   - Ratio ~0.83 - can be used to scale formant frequencies
   - For 5-year-old: pharynx ~4.4 cm, oral cavity ~6.4 cm

2. **Glottal Source Parameters**
   - Average airflow: 140-200 cm^3/s (controls AV amplitude)
   - Peak airflow: 200-700 cm^3/s (affects waveform shape)
   - Glottal opening area: 0.05-0.2 cm^2 for modal voice
   - For breathy voice: area increases to 0.1-0.4 cm^2

3. **Aspiration Noise**
   - Requires glottal area 0.1-0.4 cm^2
   - Airflow 500-1500 cm^3/s
   - Reynolds number exceeds 1800 for turbulence

4. **Frication Noise**
   - Constriction area: 0.05-0.2 cm^2
   - Supraglottal constriction sizes for /s/, /sh/: 0.05-0.15 cm^2
   - Labiodental /f/, /v/ and dental fricatives: area may exceed 0.15 cm^2

5. **Nasal Coupling**
   - Velopharyngeal opening for nasals: 0.2-0.8 cm^2
   - Nasal tract adds ~25 cm^3 volume with complex geometry
   - Introduces zeros (antiresonances) due to side branch coupling

6. **Pressure-Flow Relationships**
   - For vowels: subglottal pressure ~8 cm H2O typical
   - Airflow roughly proportional to sqrt(pressure drop) for turbulent conditions
   - Laminar flow in narrowest constrictions at low flow rates

7. **Source-Filter Independence Assumption**
   - Generally valid for vowels where source (glottis) is acoustically isolated from filter (supraglottal tract)
   - Breaks down for fricatives where source location is within the filter
   - For voiced fricatives: both glottal and supraglottal sources active simultaneously
