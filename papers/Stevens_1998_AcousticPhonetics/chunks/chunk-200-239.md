## Key Findings

### Sound Radiation (pp. 200-202)
- Sound radiates from the mouth opening, nose (when velopharyngeal port is open), and through the walls of the vocal tract
- Wall radiation: Sound transmits through tissue and radiates from outer surfaces of head and neck
- Above 100 Hz, wall impedance is an acoustic mass in series with resistance
- For F1 below ~300 Hz, neck radiation contributes significantly (about 8 dB below mouth contribution at F1=300 Hz)
- Estimation: U_a approximately equals U_w/3 (wall velocity component)
- Complete vocal tract closure (for stops): F1 of the combination of M_w and C_v is about 190 Hz for adults; sound radiates from head/neck surfaces

### Ear Canal Transfer Function (pp. 203-205)
- Ear canal length: ~2.5 cm for adults
- Outer diameter: ~0.7 cm, cross-sectional area: ~0.4 cm^2
- Transfer function close to unity (0 dB) at low frequencies
- Peak at ~3000 Hz (lowest resonance of ear canal): 15-20 dB greater than low-frequency response
- Pinna has effects above ~4000 Hz
- Middle ear reflex: Contracts when SPL exceeds ~90 dB (0.0002 dyne/cm^2), decreasing transfer function by ~10 dB below 1 kHz

### Cochlear Mechanics (pp. 205-210)
- Cochlear channel: ~35 mm long, 1.3-2.2 mm effective diameter
- Stapes velocity at 1 kHz: ~4 x 10^-5 cm^3/s per 1 dyne/cm^2 at tympanic membrane
- Basilar membrane: Wider and more compliant at apex, narrower and stiffer at base
- Frequency-to-place mapping:
  - High frequencies: maximum response near base (stapes end)
  - Low frequencies: maximum response near apex (helicotrema)
  - Midpoint (~1700 Hz) at approximately center of cochlea
  - Roughly linear frequency-position relationship up to ~500 Hz, then logarithmic
- Time delay: Maximum ~3 ms for points near apex (for signals >1000 Hz, delay <1 ms near base)

### Auditory Nerve Responses (pp. 211-223)
- Hair cells: ~12,000 outer, ~3,500 inner, arranged along basilar membrane
- Hair cell stereocilia: 5 A diameter, 20-50 A length, with tip links
- Resting potential: ~-70 mV
- ~30,000 nerve fibers innervate hair cells (~8 afferent fibers per inner hair cell)
- Spontaneous rates: 0-100 spikes/sec (most fibers: 40-80 spikes/sec)
- Characteristic frequency (CF): Frequency with lowest threshold for a fiber
- Tuning curves: Sharp slopes above CF, gradual "tails" below CF
- Saturation: Occurs ~30-40 dB above threshold

#### Responses to Vowels
- Fibers with CF near F1 and F2 show greater response rates at low SPL
- At higher SPL, saturation makes formant pattern less discernible
- Period histograms show synchronization with fundamental frequency (F0) and formant periods
- Synchrony index measurable from Fourier transform of period histograms
- Phase locking (synchrony) robust for low-frequency fibers, reduced above ~3 kHz

#### Responses to Consonant-Vowel Transitions
- Formant transitions create distinct response patterns during the transition interval
- Context (preceding consonant) affects response pattern
- /n/ preceding vowel: Depresses low-CF fiber responses (adaptation)
- /s/ preceding vowel: Depresses high-CF fiber responses
- High-CF fibers show synchrony with F1 and F2; fibers with low spontaneous rates preserve synchrony with formants more robustly in noise

### Psychophysical Thresholds and Discrimination (pp. 224-228)

#### Absolute Threshold
- Minimum audible field (MAF) curve: Minimum ~3-4 kHz
- Threshold rises sharply above ~17 kHz (at age 20) and below ~1 kHz
- Cutoff frequency decreases with age (to ~8 kHz by 65 years)
- Duration effect: Threshold increases ~3 dB per halving of duration below ~100 ms

#### Just Noticeable Difference (JND) for Amplitude
- Amplitude JND: 0.3-1.0 dB for pure tones and wideband noise
- Slightly greater at low frequencies near threshold
- JND for F2 formant peak: ~3 dB (considerably greater than overall amplitude JND)

#### JND for Bandwidth
- Noise-excited formants: JND is 15-20 Hz for relatively narrow formants (BW ~50 Hz)
- Increases to 20-30 Hz for formants with BW ~100 Hz
- For wider formants or periodic excitation: JND 35-80 Hz

#### Pitch/Frequency Discrimination
- Mel scale: 1000 mels = 1000 Hz; equal perceptual distances at equal mel distances
- Below ~500 Hz: Roughly linear frequency-to-pitch relation
- Above ~500 Hz: Logarithmic relation (equal log frequency changes = equal pitch changes)
- JND for frequency:
  - ~1 Hz at 1 Hz (very low frequencies)
  - ~2 Hz at 2 kHz
  - ~10 Hz at 4 kHz
  - Becomes fixed number of mels above ~4 kHz
- JND for formant frequency in single-prominence vowel: 10-20 Hz (for F1 and F2 in normal range)
- JND for F2: 20-100 Hz (depending on relation to other formants)

#### Duration Discrimination
- JND for duration proportional to sqrt(T) for T < 500 ms
- For T = 100 ms: Delta T approximately 10 ms
- For T = 200 ms: Delta T approximately 20 ms
- Temporal order discrimination: Requires 15-20 ms separation between onsets

### Masking (pp. 229-237)

#### Simultaneous Masking
- Forward masking extends ~50 ms after masker offset
- Backward masking extends much shorter (~few ms) before masker onset
- Critical ratio: ~17 dB (constant up to ~1 kHz), increases at higher frequencies
- Signal-to-noise ratio at masked threshold approximately constant at 17-18 dB up to 1 kHz

#### Critical Band
- Critical bandwidth (CB): Frequency band within which noise energy effectively masks a tone
- Formula: CB = 25 + 75[1 + 1.4f^2]^0.69 (f in kHz, CB in Hz)
- Approximately 100 Hz up to ~500 Hz center frequency
- Increases with frequency above ~500 Hz
- Bark scale: 24 critical bands from 1 to 24, with center frequencies and bandwidths tabulated

#### Frequency Selectivity
- Psychophysical tuning curves similar to physiological tuning curves (auditory nerve)
- Sharp cutoff above probe frequency, gradual tail below
- Width of critical band equal to ~140 mels on average

### Perception of Two-Formant Sounds (pp. 238-239)
- When F_b - F_a < 3.5 bark, listeners perceive a single spectral prominence
- Center of gravity effect: Perceived frequency F' depends on relative amplitudes of F_a and F_b
- If formants closer than critical distance, matching frequency (F') is between F_a and F_b
- If formants farther apart, listeners match to either F_a or F_b depending on relative amplitude

## Rules/Algorithms

### Frequency-to-Place Mapping in Cochlea
1. Below ~500 Hz: Roughly linear relationship between frequency and position
2. Above ~500 Hz: Logarithmic relationship
3. Midpoint at ~1700 Hz corresponds to center of cochlea (~17 mm from base)

### Critical Bandwidth Calculation
```
CB(Hz) = 25 + 75 * [1 + 1.4 * f_kHz^2]^0.69
```
Where f_kHz is center frequency in kilohertz.

### Two-Formant Integration Rule
When two spectral peaks F_a and F_b have spacing (F_b - F_a) < 3.5 bark:
- Listeners perceive single prominence at frequency F'
- F' depends on relative amplitudes (A_a and A_b)
- Equal amplitudes: F' approximately equals (F_a + F_b)/2
- Unequal amplitudes: F' shifts toward the stronger peak

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The time constant of the decay of the envelope of the oscillation is roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the bandwidth of the frequency response measured at this point, that is, the bandwidth of a response function like that shown in figure 4.8." (p. 210)

> "This two-tone inhibition phenomenon shows that caution should be used in inferring the response of an auditory nerve fiber to a complex stimulus based on examination of the responses to single tones." (p. 216)

> "These few examples of auditory nerve responses to speechlike stimuli indicate that some acoustic attributes that help to signal a phonetic distinction are preserved and may be enhanced in the activity of auditory nerve fibers." (p. 223)

> "Discrimination of changes in formant frequency has also been determined for vowel-like stimuli containing several formants (Flanagan, 1955; Kewley-Port and Watson, 1994). As we have seen in section 3.2, when the frequency of a formant in a vowel is changed, it is accompanied by changes in the amplitudes of the spectral peaks associated with that formant and with other formants. The sensitivity of formant amplitude to a given change in formant frequency is especially great when two formants are close together in frequency." (p. 228)

> "The width of a critical band is equal to about 140 mels, on average, where the mel scale is defined as in figure 4.23." (p. 235)

> "When the spacing F_b - F_a was equal to about 3.5 bark... the results on the left side of the figure are obtained... is different: one subject tends to set F' equal either to F_a or to F_b depending on the relative amplitudes, and the other subject shows large variability." (p. 239)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer / TTS System

1. **Formant Discrimination Thresholds**: The JND for formant frequencies (10-30 Hz for F1/F2) provides guidance on how precise formant trajectories need to be. Changes smaller than ~10-20 Hz may not be perceptually relevant.

2. **Formant Bandwidth Effects**: Bandwidth JND of 15-30 Hz indicates that bandwidth changes in this range are perceptible. The Klatt synthesizer should model bandwidth carefully, especially during transitions.

3. **Two-Formant Integration**: When F1 and F2 are within 3.5 bark of each other (common in some vowels), the auditory system integrates them into a single perceived spectral peak at a "center of gravity" frequency. This affects perception of back vowels with close F1-F2.

4. **Critical Band Filtering**: The auditory system effectively applies ~24 overlapping bandpass filters (critical bands). For synthesis quality assessment, a critical-band filterbank analysis may be more perceptually relevant than FFT.

5. **Temporal Resolution**:
   - Duration JND ~10 ms at 100 ms segments
   - 15-20 ms needed for temporal order perception
   - Frame rates of 5-10 ms are appropriate for capturing perceptually relevant changes

6. **Amplitude Sensitivity**: Overall amplitude JND ~0.5 dB, but formant peak amplitude JND ~3 dB. This suggests overall level control needs higher precision than individual formant amplitudes.

7. **Wall Radiation During Stop Closures**: During complete vocal tract closure (stops), F1 drops to ~190 Hz and sound radiates through neck/head surfaces. This may explain low-frequency "murmur" during voiced stop closures.

8. **Ear Canal Resonance**: The ~3 kHz ear canal resonance (15-20 dB boost) affects perception. Natural speech has evolved to exploit this; synthesized speech should not artificially compensate unless explicitly modeling headphone presentation.

9. **Forward Masking**: After a loud segment, quieter following sounds may be partially masked for ~50 ms. This is relevant for consonant bursts followed by vowels - the burst may partially mask the earliest vowel onset.

10. **Adaptation Effects**: Auditory nerve fibers show rapid adaptation (~5 ms) followed by slower adaptation (~40 ms). The onset response is stronger than steady-state. This may contribute to perceptual prominence of transients.
