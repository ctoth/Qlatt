# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Research carried out by Romance dialectologists, historical linguists and phoneticians since the end of the XIX century has contributed to clarify the role of articulatory factors in sound change. By focusing on data on Romance dialects and on theoretical approaches advocated by Romance linguists in the past, the present paper attempts to show the relevance of articulatory detail to the understanding of sound change processes and phonetic production mechanisms.

## Our Interpretation

This paper establishes that articulatory factors—not just perceptual or acoustic properties—drive sound changes in Romance language dialects, demonstrated through historical phonetic data on vowel shifts, velar palatalization, consonant weakening/strengthening, and transitional segments. For speech synthesis, this work clarifies how subtle differences in tongue position, closure degree, and gesture timing can systematically influence which phonetic changes occur, providing a mechanistic foundation for understanding why certain articulations are preferred over others in natural speech evolution and enabling more accurate coarticulation modeling in formant synthesizers like Klatt.
