This paper presents the Fujisaki model for generating F0 contours by superimposing phrase components (from impulse commands through a critically-damped system) and accent components (from step commands through another critically-damped system) onto a baseline frequency. The key contribution is establishing physiological grounding for the model parameters in cricothyroid muscle mechanics and demonstrating applicability across 14 languages by varying only the command patterns while keeping response characteristics constant. This work provides a principled, parametric alternative to rule-based F0 generation in TTS, with clear separation between language-specific prosodic patterns and universal physiological constraints.
