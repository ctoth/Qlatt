The Motor Theory of Speech Perception proposes that listeners perceive speech by recovering the intended articulatory gestures of the speaker rather than by analyzing acoustic patterns directly. The theory explains how perception remains robust despite acoustic variability, trading relations between cues, and the absence of invariant acoustic features for individual phonemes. For speech synthesis, the theory validates formant-based approaches by showing that listeners accept any acoustic pattern that plausibly represents motor gestures, making context-appropriate formant trajectories and proper timing more important than acoustic exactness.
