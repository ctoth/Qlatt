This paper presents an experimental study using electrical analogs of the vocal and nasal tracts to systematically measure the acoustic effects of velopharyngeal coupling on vowel spectra. The key findings establish that F1 amplitude reduction (~8 dB), F1 bandwidth increase, and vowel-dependent nasalization sensitivity are the primary acoustic correlates of vowel nasality, with high vowels (/i, u/) nasalizing more readily than low vowels (/ɑ, ɔ/). For Klatt synthesizer implementation, these results provide quantitative targets for modeling nasalized vowels: reducing F1 amplitude by 5-10 dB and increasing F1 bandwidth by 1.5-3x to achieve perceptually natural nasality across the vowel inventory.
