# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The acoustic mechanism of fricative consonants was studied in the context of three domains: speech, mechanical models, and theoretical models. All fricative configurations have in common a small turbulence-producing constriction within the vocal tract. Thus, preliminary experiments were conducted using a mechanical model having this basic configuration of a constriction in a tube. Parameters such as constriction area, length, location, and degree of inlet tapering, and presence of an obstacle, were varied. It was found that acoustically the most significant parameters are the presence of an obstacle, the length of the front cavity, and the flowrate. Therefore, configurations in which only these parameters were varied, referred to as the obstacle and no-obstacle cases, were examined more thoroughly and modeled theoretically.

A source function for the obstacle case was derived from the far-field sound pressure measured when the obstacle was located in space, downstream of a constriction in a baffle. The directivity pattern produced by the obstacle in this position was similar to that of a dipole, as expected. A dipole source located inside a duct is equivalent to a pressure source in a transmission-line model, when only the longitudinal modes of a duct are considered. The filter function, corresponding to the effect of the duct on such a pressure source, was derived for the transmission-line representations of two configurations in which the obstacle was located inside a front cavity of nonzero length. The spectra predicted by this source-filter model, when compared to the far-field pressure measurements of the equivalent mechanical models, provided a very close match in both absolute sound pressure level and spectral shape. Thus in this case the presence of the duct does not significantly alter the sound source, and a simple linear source-filter model works well.

For the no-obstacle case, it was not possible to derive a source from a free-field measurement, so the validity of a source-tract model could not be checked directly. Investigation of the pressure versus flow-velocity power laws showed evidence of source-tract interaction for the no-obstacle case, but none for the obstacle case.

Spectral measures were developed that characterized the acoustic differences caused by the different types of sources for the obstacle and no-obstacle cases. Analysis of real speech in terms of these spectral measures revealed that fricatives are more similar to the obstacle than to the no-obstacle case. More complex speech-like mechanical models were developed and the acoustic characteristics of the sounds generated by those models were compared to the characteristics of speech sounds, again in terms of the spectral measures. Very good models of /s/ and /ʃ/ were obtained by using an obstacle at right angles to the flow and varying the constriction location. For the fricatives /f, θ/, in which the constriction is located forward in the tract, the shape of the constriction was crucial. Constrictions that allowed the jet to become in contact with a surface produced sounds that most closely resembled the analyzed examples of these fricatives. For /x/ and /ɣ/, in which the constriction is located 4 to 6 cm back from the mouth, a surface also caused the mechanical model spectra to become the most like the speech spectra. However, in general it appears that the constriction shape affects the far-field spectrum less as the front cavity is lengthened. The model for /s, ʃ/ appears to be that of a series pressure source, located at the teeth. For the fricatives other than /s,ʃ/, a "distributed obstacle", modeled as a distributed pressure source, may be the dominant acoustic mechanism.

The whistles generated by several configurations were also investigated. Orifice tones occurred for untapered constrictions, at a greater range of constriction sizes than predicted by previous studies. The frequencies were related to the constriction length. Edgetones occurred for configurations including an obstacle, at frequencies related to the flowrate and distance to the obstacle. The occurrence, frequency and amplitude of the whistle tones were affected by the constriction shape and the presence of a tube surrounding the obstacle.

Edgetones were generated by the /s/-like and /ʃ/-like mechanical models that were similar acoustically to the whistles produced by a subject with the /s/ and /ʃ/ configurations. An even more striking parallel between the whistles produced by speech-like models and humans was found for the typical bilabial whistles produced by /θ/-like configurations. Two constrictions, reproducing the role of tongue and lips, were necessary to model these whistles. The agreement in flow range, frequency, and control parameters of the holetones thus produced and the whistles generated by humans was good enough to suggest that the same acoustic mechanism occurred in both the models and the human vocal tract.

## Our Interpretation

Shadle's thesis establishes the acoustic-phonetic foundations of fricative consonants by systematically investigating how different constriction geometries (obstacle vs. distributed, cavity length, constriction shape, location) generate distinct fricative spectra through source-filter mechanisms. The work demonstrates that fricatives divide into distinct acoustic classes based on whether sound generation is dominated by an obstacle-generated source (sibilants /s, ʃ/) or distributed surface-generated sources (non-sibilants /f, θ, x/), with implications for how mechanical parameters determine spectral characteristics. For speech synthesis, this research provides crucial guidance on fricative amplitude levels, spectral tilt characteristics, constriction shape effects on frequency response, and bandwidth settings—enabling principled parameter selection for formant-based fricative synthesis rather than trial-and-error tuning.
