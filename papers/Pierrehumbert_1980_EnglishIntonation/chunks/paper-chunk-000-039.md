## Key Concepts

### Fundamental Thesis Structure
The thesis develops:
1. A **grammar** that generates sequences of L and H tones as structured strings
2. A **metrical representation** of the text (using Liberman & Prince 1977 grid)
3. **Rules** for lining up the tune with the text

### Three Components of Intonation Representation
1. **Pitch accent grammar** - generates well-formed tonal sequences
2. **Metrical grid** - describes which syllables are stressed and their relative strength
3. **Association rules** - map tones to text positions

### Intonation Phrase Structure
An intonation phrase consists of:
- One or more **pitch accents** (on stressed syllables)
- A **phrase accent** (immediately after nuclear pitch accent)
- A **boundary tone** (at the phrase boundary)

There is also a leading boundary tone after a pause.

### Pitch Accent Types
Pitch accents are either:
- A **single tone** (H* or L*)
- A **pair of tones** (bitonal accents)

The starred tone (*) aligns with the stressed syllable. The unstarred tone leads or trails.

## Tonal Inventory

### Single Tone Pitch Accents
- **H*** - High tone on accented syllable
- **L*** - Low tone on accented syllable

### Bitonal Pitch Accents (from page 29 finite-state grammar)
- **L*+H** - Low on stressed syllable, followed by High
- **L+H*** - Low leading, High on stressed syllable
- **H*+L** - High on stressed syllable, followed by Low
- **H+L*** - High leading, Low on stressed syllable
- **H*+H-** - High on stressed syllable plus phrase accent
- **H-+L*** - Phrase accent leading to Low

### Phrase Accents
- **H-** - High phrase accent
- **L-** - Low phrase accent

### Boundary Tones
- **H%** - High boundary tone
- **L%** - Low boundary tone

### Notation System (page 28)
- **%** marks phrase boundary, used as diacritic for boundary tones (L%, H%)
- ***** marks the tone aligned with stressed syllable
- **-** (raised hyphen) marks phrase accent or trailing tone

## Phonological Rules

### Finite-State Grammar for Tonal Sequences (page 29)
The well-formed tonal sequences can be generated by a finite-state transition network:

```
Boundary Tone --> Pitch Accents --> Phrase Accent --> Boundary Tone
    (H%/L%)        (one or more)       (H-/L-)          (H%/L%)
```

All sequences of: nuclear pitch accent + phrase accent + boundary tone are well-formed in English.

### Pitch Accent Assignment Rules (pages 37-39)

**Rule 22a**: If a foot has a pitch accent, any foot of equal or stronger metrical strength in the phrase also has a pitch accent, **except that** there are no pitch accents after the nuclear stress of the phrase.

**Rule 22b**: There are no pitch accents after the nuclear stress of the phrase.

### Relative Prominence Projection Rule (page 36)
In any constituent on which the strong-weak relation is defined, the designated terminal element of its strong subconstituent is metrically stronger than the designated terminal element of its weak subconstituent.

### Nuclear Stress Rule (page 33)
The Nuclear Stress Rule labels the stronger and weaker nodes of each pair. It appears to be a default case at the phrase level. The labeling at any level of the tree may be reversed to highlight particular information.

## Phonetic Implementation

### F0 and Stress Relationship (page 39)
- A **H* accent on a syllable with more stress** corresponds to a **higher F0 value** than a H* on a syllable with less stress
- For **L* accents**, the situation is reversed: an L* accent on a syllable with stronger stress is **lower** than that on a less stressed syllable
- The subordination among accents is reflected in their phonetic values

### Segmental Effects on F0 (page 14)
- F0 at vowel onset after an **unvoiced consonant** is considerably **higher** than after a sonorant consonant
- Sharp **dip in F0** in the vicinity of voiced obstruents and glottal stops
- High vowels raise F0; difference between high and low vowel can be **as much as 25 Hz**
- These effects are "noise" from intonation system perspective and must be factored out

### Prominence and Pitch Accent Height (page 40)
- Each pitch accent has an associated **prominence value**
- Prominence is **continuously variable**
- The prominence of a metrically stronger accent is at least as great as that of a weaker accent (though not necessarily greater)
- "Amount of emphasis" controls this variation

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The different tunes are described as structured strings of L and H tones generated by a finite-state grammar. The strings consist of one or more pitch accents, which are aligned with stressed syllables on the basis of the metrical pattern of the text, plus two additional tones which characterize the intonation of the end of the phrase. The pitch accents are either a tone, or a pair of tones on which a strength relation is defined." (page 2 - Abstract)

> "The well-formed tunes for an intonation phrase are comprised of one or more pitch accents followed by a phrase accent and then a boundary tone." (page 22)

> "A H* accent on a syllable with more stress corresponds to a higher F0 value than a H* on a syllable with less stress. For L* accents, the situation is reversed; a L* accent on a syllable with stronger stress is lower than that on a less stressed syllable." (page 39)

> "In the subsequent chapters, the term 'prominence' will be used to refer to the aggregate of metrical strength and emphasis, as it pertains to the control of tonal values. We will assume that each pitch accent has an associated prominence value, that prominence is continuously variable, and that the prominence of a metrically stronger accent is at least as great as that of a weaker accent, though not necessarily greater." (page 40)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Tone inventory is small**: Only L and H tones, combined into ~7 pitch accent types plus phrase accents and boundary tones.

2. **Finite-state grammar**: The tune structure is simple - can be generated with a small state machine:
   - Start with optional boundary tone
   - Generate sequence of pitch accents
   - End with phrase accent + boundary tone

3. **Metrical grid drives accent placement**:
   - Pitch accents go on metrically strong syllables
   - All feet equal or stronger than nuclear accent get pitch accents (except post-nuclear)
   - Nuclear accent is on the designated terminal element of the phrase

4. **Stress affects F0 height**:
   - For H*: stronger stress = higher F0
   - For L*: stronger stress = lower F0
   - This is the "prominence" parameter

5. **Phrase accent controls post-nuclear region**:
   - L- phrase accent: F0 stays low after nuclear accent until boundary
   - H- phrase accent: F0 rises after nuclear accent

6. **Boundary tone determines phrase-final shape**:
   - L%: phrase ends low (declarative)
   - H%: phrase ends high (yes/no question)

7. **Phrase boundary detection**:
   - Can occur at pauses
   - Can occur with only final syllable lengthening (no pause)
   - Related to syntactic structure but with flexibility

### Key Insight for Implementation
The system is **compositional**: the meaning of the F0 contour comes from combining:
- Pitch accent type (local shape)
- Phrase accent (post-nuclear trajectory)
- Boundary tone (phrase-final target)

This suggests F0 can be generated by:
1. Placing pitch accent targets on stressed syllables
2. Interpolating with phrase accent after nuclear accent
3. Reaching boundary tone target at phrase end
