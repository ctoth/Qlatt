This paper proposes hybrid word sense disambiguation methods that combine knowledge-based (WordNet taxonomy) and corpus-based (Maximum Entropy) approaches to improve accuracy beyond either method alone. The key contributions include the Specification Marks algorithm using WordNet hierarchies and a Maximum Entropy supervised learning method with novel collapsed features, demonstrating ~79.8% upper-bound potential accuracy compared to ~64% for individual methods. For TTS systems, this work directly enables homograph disambiguation (e.g., distinguishing pronunciations of "read" or "bow"), improves lexicon design through context-aware pronunciation selection, and provides confidence scores for robust sense resolution in prosody generation and G2P conversion.
