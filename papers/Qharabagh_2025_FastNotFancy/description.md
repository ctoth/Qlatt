This paper demonstrates that rich, balanced homograph datasets can dramatically improve both neural and rule-based grapheme-to-phoneme conversion systems, achieving ~30% improvement in homograph disambiguation while maintaining real-time performance for accessibility applications. The authors introduce HomoRich, a 528,891-sentence Persian dataset with semi-automated LLM-powered generation, and show that a lightweight statistical context-word matching method (HomoFast eSpeak) matches neural performance while being 50x faster. For speech synthesis and accessibility, this work proves that data quality combined with simple rule-based methods outperforms complex neural approaches when speed is critical.
