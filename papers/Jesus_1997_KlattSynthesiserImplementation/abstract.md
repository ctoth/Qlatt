# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

In this work it is described a software tool implementing the Klatt synthesiser to be used on a teaching laboratory. The user interface allows an easy edition of the synthesis parameters, thus the student may quick and easily change the phonetic characteristics of a vowel and listen to the result or seeing its time or frequency properties.

## Our Interpretation

This paper presents a MATLAB-based software implementation of the Klatt speech synthesizer designed for educational use in phonetics laboratories. The key contribution is a user-friendly graphical interface that allows students to directly manipulate Klatt synthesis parameters, observe vowel transformations in real-time, and analyze spectrograms and frequency responses. The work demonstrates the pedagogical value of interactive parameter exploration for understanding acoustic speech production and validates the implementation through Portuguese vowel synthesis and English word examples.
