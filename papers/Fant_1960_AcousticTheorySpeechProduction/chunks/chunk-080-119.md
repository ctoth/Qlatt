## Key Concepts

### Formant-Articulation Relationships (Section 1.4)
- **Constriction location effects:** F1 increases with constriction area increase; F2 behavior depends on location
- **Centralization of back vowels:** Reduction of area contrasts shifts F-pattern toward neutral vowel
- **Standing wave patterns:** Formants F1-F4 have distinct volume velocity distributions (Fig. 1.4-12)
- **Three-parameter model:** Location of constriction center, minimum constriction area, lip opening

### X-Ray Data Collection (Section 2.1)
- Subject: 38-year-old Russian male, native of Moscow, actor (Stanislavski school)

- Films: Dupont with detail screens
- Head position: upright, fixed against headrest at occipital region
- Central ray through crown of first upper molar

### Vowel Acoustics

- [o]: Constriction at x = 6.5 cm, A_min = 0.8 cm^2
- [u]: Small lip opening (0.65 cm^2), constriction at back
- [i-bar]: Wide front cavity, narrow back

- [e]: Intermediate configuration

### Formant Dependency Coefficients (Table 2.33-3)

## Vocal Tract Models

### Three-Parameter Model (Fig. 1.4-10)
- Horn-shaped back cavity representing pharynx
- Cylindrical tongue constriction section
- Horn-shaped lip section (optional)
- Parameters: constriction center coordinate, minimum area A_min, lip opening A_l

### Standing Wave Patterns (Fig. 1.4-12, after Chiba & Kajiyama 1941)
- **F1:** Single velocity maximum at lips, single pressure maximum at glottis
- **F2:** Two velocity nodes (one internal), two pressure maxima
- **F3:** Three velocity nodes, three pressure maxima
- **F4:** Four velocity nodes, four pressure maxima

Volume velocity distribution shows where constrictions affect each formant.

### Area Function Derivation Process (Fig. 2.2-5)
1. X-ray tracings provide midsagittal cross-section
2. Cross-sectional shapes estimated at multiple points
3. Continuous area function drawn
4. Quantized to 0.5 cm sections for LEA or digital calculation

### Sinus Piriformis Effect (Fig. 2.2-3, 2.2-4)
- Acts as acoustic shunt at larynx tube
- Introduces low-pass filtering (~5000 c/s cutoff)
- Causes anti-resonance and spectral dip
- Effect demonstrated by comparing models with/without sinus piriformis

## Formant Data

### Voice Source Spectrum
- Standard slope: -12 dB/octave
- Compensation added: +6 dB/octave rise
- Net effect at source+radiation: -6 dB/octave (above ~500 Hz)

### Formant Bandwidth Effects
- Calculated bandwidths from LEA somewhat narrower than real speech
- Radiation impedance provides damping close to required value
- F1 bandwidth particularly affected

### Coarticulation Indicators
- Dental consonants: Constriction at x = 14-16 cm, F3 = 1800-1600 c/s, F4 = 3050-2900 c/s
- Uvular/velar consonants: Constriction at x = 8-13 cm
- Palatal consonants: Constriction at x = 11 cm, F4 and F5 meet at ~2500 c/s

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer
1. **Source spectrum:** Use -12 dB/octave base slope with +6 dB correction = -6 dB/octave effective slope above first formant
2. **Formant targets for Russian vowels** can be directly read from Table 2.31-1
3. **Sinus piriformis** effect could be modeled as additional pole-zero pair around 3500-5000 Hz
4. **Area-to-formant mapping** provides basis for articulatory synthesis if desired

### LEA Area Coding
- 16-level logarithmic scale from 0.16 to 16 cm^2
- Steps of cube root of 2 (approximately 1.26x per step)
- Useful for discretizing area functions

### Critical Frequencies
- Cutoff frequency of LEA model: 11,250 Hz
- Typical F1 range: 200-700 Hz
- Typical F2 range: 600-2500 Hz
- Typical F3 range: 2300-3200 Hz
- F4 typically around 3200-4000 Hz

### Double Resonator Theory Limitations
- Works well for F1 prediction
- Fails for F2 of front vowels [i] and [e]
- Useful approximation for back vowels [a], [o], [u]

### Formant Sensitivity Rules
- Constriction at volume velocity maximum: formant frequency increases
- Constriction at pressure maximum: formant frequency decreases
- Front cavity primarily affects F2 for front vowels
- Back cavity primarily affects F1 for all vowels
- Larynx tube effects: raises F1 and F4, lowers F2 and F3 slightly

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "When a pipe is constricted its resonance frequency becomes low or high according as the constricted part is near the maximum point of the volume current (N) or of the excess pressure (P)." (p. 86, citing Chiba 1941)

> "The effect of a local constriction or expansion of the vocal tract may thus be predicted on the basis of the knowledge of the standing wave pattern of the system before the articulatory change is introduced." (p. 87)

> "The first two formants are, however, generally sufficient for stating the acoustic relations. The gravity of the phonemes /u/, /o/, and /a/ is correlated with a relatively lower F2 compared with other vowels." (p. 110)

> "There is a clear positive correlation between tongue height and the position of the velum indicating an incomplete closure to the nasal cavities in very open vowels, definite in the case of [a] but doubtful for [e] and [o]." (p. 114)

> "The back resonator is more closely connected with F1, than with F2 and that the front resonator is more closely connected with F2 than with F1." (p. 118)

> "It is highly probable that the voice source, as well as fricative sound sources, are associated with non-linear impedances." (p. 98)
