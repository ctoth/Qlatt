# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Whereas the perception of emotion from facial expression has been extensively studied cross-culturally, little is known about judges' ability to infer emotion from vocal cues. This article reports the results from a study conducted in nine countries in Europe, the United States, and Asia on vocal emotion portrayals of anger, sadness, fear, joy, and neutral voice as produced by professional German actors. Data show an overall accuracy of 66% across all emotions and countries. Although accuracy was substantially better than chance, there were sizable differences ranging from 74% in Germany to 52% in Indonesia. However, patterns of confusion were very similar across all countries. These data suggest the existence of similar inference rules from vocal expression across cultures. Generally, accuracy decreased with increasing language dissimilarity from German in spite of the use of language-free speech samples. It is concluded that culture- and language-specific paralinguistic patterns may influence the decoding process.

## Our Interpretation

This study demonstrates that vocal emotion recognition exhibits substantial cross-cultural universality, with listeners from nine countries correctly identifying emotions (anger, sadness, fear, joy) in German-accented speech at 66% accuracy—far above chance—using semantically meaningless multilingual sentences. The remarkable consistency of confusion patterns across cultures (high correlations r=.85) suggests that emotional acoustic cues operate similarly across listeners regardless of linguistic background, though language dissimilarity from German correlates with recognition accuracy, indicating that prosodic and segmental features may convey emotion universally but with modulation by phonological context. For speech synthesis, this work establishes that synthesized emotional speech can be understood cross-culturally if acoustic parameters match universal patterns, though achieving natural-sounding emotional variation requires careful attention to language-specific paralinguistic cues and the distinction between high-arousal emotions (anger, fear) versus subtle emotional expressions like joy that lack clear universal acoustic markers.
