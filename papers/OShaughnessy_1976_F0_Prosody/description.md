O'Shaughnessy (1976) presents a comprehensive rule-based system for generating fundamental frequency (F0) contours in text-to-speech through a two-level architecture: a High Level System that maps semantic and syntactic information to prosodic indicators, and a Low Level System that converts those indicators to actual F0 values with phonetic adjustments. The thesis derives quantitative F0 rules from recordings of multiple speakers including an accent priority list based on word class, declination models, phrase boundary marking via continuation rises, and phonetic effects from consonant voicing and vowel height. This work establishes the foundational framework for prosodic F0 generation in speech synthesis, providing the word class accent hierarchy, declination decay model, and phonetic adjustment rules that remain central to modern TTS systems including Qlatt.
