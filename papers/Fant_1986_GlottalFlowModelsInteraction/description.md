This paper introduces the LF (Liljencrants-Fant) four-parameter model for glottal flow derivative and analyzes how source-filter interaction causes the actual glottal flow to deviate from the idealized glottal area function. Key findings include the relationship between return time constant $t_a$ and spectral tilt ($F_a = 1/(2\pi t_a)$), documentation of interaction phenomena like pulse skewing and double-peak flow derivatives driven by F1 resonance, and the discovery that F0 coinciding with F1 minimizes air consumption in soprano singing. This work is foundational for understanding and implementing the LF glottal source model used in formant synthesizers like Qlatt.
