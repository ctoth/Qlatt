This paper is a comprehensive historical and technical review of text-to-speech conversion systems from 1939 to 1987, covering the complete TTS pipeline including linguistic analysis, pronunciation rules, duration modeling, prosody generation, and formant synthesis, with detailed specification of the Klattalk synthesizer and its 19 control parameters. Key contributions include complete synthesis-by-rule methodology with over 300 references, 11 duration rules, formant transition rules based on locus theory, intelligibility benchmarks showing DECtalk achieving 97% accuracy on the Modified Rhyme Test, and discussion of commercial TTS systems like DECtalk and MITalk. This foundational work matters for speech synthesis because it provides the definitive specification of the cascade/parallel hybrid formant architecture, establishes the linguistic and acoustic principles necessary for natural-sounding synthesis, and demonstrates that rule-based formant synthesis can achieve nearly-natural intelligibility when properly implemented.
