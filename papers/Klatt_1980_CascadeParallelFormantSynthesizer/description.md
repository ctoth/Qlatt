This paper presents the complete specification and FORTRAN implementation of a cascade/parallel formant synthesizer that models speech production using digital resonators to filter voicing, aspiration, and frication sources through a vocal tract transfer function. The key contribution is the detailed architecture showing how to route different sound sources (voiced voicing and aspiration to cascade, frication to parallel), with specific parameter tables for English phonemes, coefficient calculations for digital resonators, and synthesis strategies such as quasi-sinusoidal voicing and plosive burst generation. This work became foundational for all subsequent Klatt-based text-to-speech systems by providing a flexible, well-documented, and computationally efficient formant synthesis framework that achieves 98% vowel and 95% consonant identification accuracy while avoiding the calibration problems of hardware synthesizers.
