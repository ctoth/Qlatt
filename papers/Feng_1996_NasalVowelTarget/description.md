This paper investigates the acoustic features of nasal and nasalized vowels, proposing that the pharyngonasal tract configuration serves as a stable acoustic target characterized by two characteristic resonances at approximately 300 Hz and 1000 Hz. The authors use transmission line vocal tract models and experimental measurements to demonstrate how vowel formants evolve toward this nasal target through predictable pole-zero patterns that vary by vowel category (high/front, mid, and low/back vowels). These findings are critical for speech synthesis because they explain how to model nasalization as a trajectory toward a fixed spectral target rather than simply adding nasal coupling, enabling more natural-sounding nasal vowels and consonants in synthesis systems like Klatt.
