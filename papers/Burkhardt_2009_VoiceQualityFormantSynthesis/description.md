This paper presents explicit rule-based formulas for modifying Klatt synthesizer parameters to simulate five phonation types (breathy, tense, whispery, creaky, falsetto) based on Laver's voice quality framework. The key contribution is a parameterized approach using a single "rate" variable (0-100%) that controls variations in open quotient, spectral tilt, formant bandwidths, and amplitudes, with perceptual validation showing clear links between phonation types and emotional impressions. These techniques are directly applicable to formant synthesis systems for enabling emotional expression and speaking style variation in TTS without requiring large speech corpora.
