## Key Findings

### Pressure-Flow Relationships
- Pressure drop across constriction is nonlinear function of volume velocity U
- Incremental resistance is the slope of pressure drop vs. U curve (useful for AC fluctuations)
- Head loss equation (Binder 1962): Total pressure drop proportional to sum of inlet, outlet, and straight section losses
- K2 and K3 coefficients determined empirically for each constriction geometry

### Acoustic Results - No-Obstacle Case
- Peak frequencies at 2:1 ratio for front cavity length l_f = 3-6 cm (quarter-wavelength resonances)
- Frequencies f = nc/4l where n = 1,3,... with bandwidths increasing with frequency
- Total sound power from free jet: P_T proportional to V^8 * d^2 (Goldstein 1976)
- Free jet noise spectrum peak at 0.15V/d; power increases as 7th power of flow velocity
- Front cavity length l_f controls peak frequencies; flowrate controls overall amplitude
- Constriction resonance f = c/2l_c predicted at 13 kHz for l_c = 1.0 cm, 6.2 kHz for l_c = 2.5 cm

### Unstable Behavior (Whistles)
- Whistles occur with tapered constriction inlets; no whistles with untapered
- Whistles are "orifice tones" caused by unstable boundary layers within constriction
- Critical parameter: l_c/d ratio (constriction length to diameter)
- Constrictions with l_c/d between 0.25 and 4.0 and l_c/d = 0.25 or 4.0 did not whistle
- Constrictions with l_c/d between 0.5 and 2.0 whistled (for tapered inlet)
- Whistle frequency related to half-wavelength of effective constriction length
- Rectangular constrictions produce louder, clearer whistles than circular ones (flat jet, uniform vortex)

### Stable Obstacle Configurations
- Obstacle presence heightens spectral peaks and introduces troughs (zeros)
- Obstacle generates dipole-like sound source
- Directivity pattern similar to dipole (amplitude varies with angle theta from jet axis)
- Key parameter: l_o/d (normalized obstacle distance)
- Strouhal number S = fd/V important for characterizing whistle behavior
- Amplitude approximately 20 dB higher with obstacle vs no-obstacle at same parameters

### Sound Source Modeling
- Sound produced at obstacle modeled as flow dipoles
- Dipole source strength S = Ud depends on flowrate
- Image dipole accounts for baffle reflection
- Dipole generates volume-velocity U fluctuations

## Equations Found (LaTeX)

### Head Loss (Eq 2.1)
$$h = K_1 \frac{V_c^2}{2g}$$
Where:
- h = head loss (cm)
- V_c = velocity through constriction (cm/sec)
- g = acceleration due to gravity (cm/sec^2)

### Pressure Drop (Eq 2.2, Heinz 1956)
$$\Delta p = K_2 \frac{\rho U^2}{2A^2} + K_3 U$$
Where:
- Delta_p_tot = pressure drop across constriction (dyne/cm^2)
- U = volume velocity through constriction (cc/sec)
- K_2 = empirically derived constant (dimensionless)

Where: A_c = cross-sectional area, c = speed of sound

### Power Exponent from Pressure Ratios (p. 44)
$$p \propto V^{n/2} d^2$$
$$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{n/2}$$
$$n = \frac{20\log_{10}p_2 - 20\log_{10}p_1}{10\log_{10}(V_2/V_1)}$$

### Far-Field Dipole Pressure (Eq 3.1)
$$\hat{p}_0(r,\theta,\omega) = \frac{\omega^2 \rho}{4\pi c} S \left[\frac{\cos\theta}{r}e^{-jkr} - \frac{\cos\phi}{R}e^{-jkR}\right]$$
Where:
- S = dipole strength
- r = distance between dipole and observer (microphone)
- theta = angle between downstream jet axis and r vector

- phi = angle between downstream jet axis and R vector
- l_0 = distance between dipole or image dipole and baffle

- c = speed of sound in air

### Source Function Estimate (Eq 3.2)
$$\hat{S}(\omega) = \frac{p_0(r,\theta,\omega)}{\hat{p}_0(r,\theta,\omega)/S(\omega)}$$

### Equivalent Pressure Source (Eq 3.3)
$$\hat{p}_s = j\left(\frac{\omega\rho}{A}\right)(\hat{U}d)$$
$$= j\left(\frac{\omega\rho}{A}\right)(\hat{S}(\omega))$$

### Transmission Line Parameters (Eq 3.4)
$$\alpha \simeq \frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} + \frac{G}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}$$
Where:
- L = rho/A = per-unit-length inductance
- C = A/(rho*c^2) = per-unit-length compliance
- R = (S/A^2)*sqrt(omega*rho*mu/2) = per-unit-length resistance
- G = S*(eta-1)/(rho*c^2)*sqrt(lambda*omega/(2*c_p*rho)) = per-unit-length conductance

### Per-Unit-Length Parameters (p. 74)
- A = tube area (cm^2)
- S = tube circumference (cm)
- rho = air density = 1.18 x 10^-3 gm/cm^3
- c = sound velocity = 34480 cm/s
- mu = viscosity coefficient = 1.86 x 10^-4 dyne-s/cm^2

- eta = adiabatic constant of air = 1.4
- c_p = specific heat of air at constant pressure = 0.24 cal/gm-deg C

### Radiation Impedance (Eq 3.6)
$$Z_R = \frac{s^2(M_A R_1 R_2 C_A) + s(M_A R_1 + M_A R_2)}{s^2 M_A R_1 C_A + s(M_A + R_1 R_2 C_A) + R_1 + R_2}$$
Where:
- M_A = (8/3) * rho/(pi^2 * a)
- R_1 = 0.1404 * rho*c/a^2
- R_2 = rho*c/(pi*a^2)
- C_A = 5.94 * a^3/(rho*c^2)
- a = radius of the mouth opening

### Incremental Resistance in Transmission Line (Eq 3.7)
$$R_i = K_2 \frac{\rho U}{A_c^2} + K_3$$
Using K_2 = 1.0 and K_3 = 8.7 for constriction area A_c = 0.079 cm^2

### Cutoff Frequency (Cross-mode)
$$f_{mn} = \frac{\alpha_{mn} c}{2a}$$
Where:
- alpha_01 = 0.5861 for first propagating cross mode
- For tube radius 1.27 cm: first cross-mode at 7950 Hz

### Transfer Function Form
$$\frac{U_{out}}{U_{in}} = \frac{K}{s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0}$$

$$\frac{U_{out}}{U_{source}} = K \frac{s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0}{s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \cdots + b_0}$$

## Rules/Algorithms

### Measuring Flow Resistance
1. Insert constriction in tube, measure pressures at 5 cm upstream of mouth
2. Vary flowrates between 50 and 690 cc/sec
3. Plot pressure drop vs. volume velocity U
4. Fit to form: Delta_p = K_2 * (rho*U^2)/(2*A^2) + K_3*U
5. Solve for K_2 and K_3 by minimizing standard deviation of K_3

### Predicting Resonance Frequencies
1. For front cavity length l_f = 3-6 cm:
   - Quarter-wavelength resonances: f = nc/4l for n = 1, 3, 5...
2. For constriction: half-wavelength resonance f = c/2l_c
3. Bandwidths of resonances increase with frequency (radiation loss increases)

### Determining Whistle vs. Non-Whistle Conditions
1. For untapered constrictions: no whistles at any flowrate
2. For tapered constrictions:
   - Circular: l_c/d between 0.25-4.0 with l_c/d = 0.25 or 4.0 no whistle
   - l_c/d between 0.5-2.0: whistles likely
3. Rectangular slot constrictions: more likely to whistle, louder when they do
4. Increasing flowrate increases whistle frequency steadily
5. Adding tube downstream can stabilize or destabilize depending on resonance alignment

### Source-Filter Model Construction
1. Measure far-field pressure p_0 at l_f = 0 cm (no front cavity)
2. Derive source function S_hat by inverse filtering
3. Derive transfer functions T_3(s), T_12(s) for different front cavity lengths
4. Predicted pressure: p_hat = p_s * T(s)
5. Compare predictions to measurements at l_f = 3.2 cm and 12 cm

### Transmission Line Model Parameters
1. Valid for frequencies where half-wavelength > tract length (< 1000 Hz for typical)
2. First cross-mode cutoff at 8000 Hz for 1.27 cm radius tube
3. Use lumped networks below cutoff, distributed networks above
4. Poles of transfer function = natural frequencies of tract
5. Zeros from source position in circuit (not at end)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The total sound power produced by a free jet is due mainly to that produced in the mixing region, that is, in the first four diameters downstream of the nozzle." (p. 43)

> "The total power of the free jet noise has a broad peak at 0.15V/d. In the vicinity of the peak frequency, the power increases as the seventh power of the flow velocity." (p. 43)

> "Whistles tend to be weakest when they are near a transition. The plot of the peak amplitude versus l_o/d clearly shows an alternation of high and low amplitudes as l_o/d increases, and a drop in amplitude when the tube is added, for the rectangular constriction." (p. 51)

> "The presence of an obstacle and front cavity have the most effect on the sound produced." (p. 59)

> "We arrive then at four models total, composed of two constriction positions, each with and without the obstacle. These will be subject to much scrutiny because they are the essence of the acoustic mechanism for fricatives." (p. 60)

> "A flow dipole is a dipole source generated by fluid flow. A dipole source can be modeled as two out-of-phase simple sources a distance d apart, each generating a volume-velocity U." (p. 66)

> "At low frequencies (ka < 0.5) the model reduces to a resistance (R_1 + R_2) and inductance in parallel; at high frequencies (ka > 5) it reduces to a resistance (R_2) with the value of the characteristic impedance of air divided by pi*a^2, the area of the mouth opening." (p. 74)

## Implementation Notes

### For Fricative Synthesis

1. **Noise Source Characteristics:**
   - Free jet noise spectrum peaks at f = 0.15V/d where V = flow velocity, d = jet diameter
   - Power proportional to V^7 (approx) near peak, V^8*d^2 overall
   - Spectrum broadband with -6 dB/octave rolloff above peak

2. **Front Cavity Resonances:**
   - Quarter-wavelength resonances: f_n = nc/(4*l_f) for n = 1, 3, 5...
   - Bandwidth increases with frequency due to radiation loss
   - For l_f = 3 cm: first resonance ~2.9 kHz, second ~8.6 kHz

3. **Obstacle Effects (relevant to teeth/lips):**
   - Adds dipole source character
   - Creates spectral zeros at half-wavelength multiples of 2*l_o
   - Increases overall amplitude by ~20 dB compared to no-obstacle
   - Directivity pattern follows dipole: amplitude varies with cos(theta)

4. **Constriction Resonance:**
   - Half-wavelength resonance f = c/(2*l_c)
   - For typical alveolar fricative l_c ~ 1 cm: resonance ~17 kHz
   - Can reinforce front-cavity resonance when aligned

5. **Whistle Avoidance:**
   - Human fricatives use untapered (rounded) constriction edges
   - Typical l_c/d ratios outside whistle range (0.5-2.0)
   - Turbulent flow rather than vortex shedding

6. **Pressure-Flow Relationship:**
   - Use R_i = K_2*(rho*U/A_c^2) + K_3 for AC impedance
   - K_2 ~ 1.0 for larger constrictions
   - K_3 dominates for small constrictions (high viscous loss)

7. **Transmission Line Model:**
   - Valid below 8 kHz (first cross-mode cutoff for typical tube)
   - Include viscous (R) and thermal (G) losses
   - Radiation impedance at mouth: use Beranek (1954) formula
