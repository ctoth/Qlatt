## Key Citations for Follow-up

1. **Klatt (1976, 1979)** - Foundational work on segmental duration and synthesis by rule; Hertz explicitly positions her model as an improvement over Klatt's linear framework. Essential reading for understanding the conventional approach that Delta improves upon.

2. **Fant (1960)** - The original acoustic theory of speech production and source-filter framework that all formant synthesis derives from. Provides theoretical foundations for multi-stream representation of source and filter components.

3. **Gay (1968)** - Critical for understanding diphthong behavior in fast speech and the undershoot phenomenon that Hertz's model elegantly explains through the "fast_speech" stream concept.

4. **Chen (1970)** - Original observation of sonorant sequence lengthening before voiced obstruents (beyond simple vowel lengthening), which motivates Hertz's nucleus-level representation.

5. **Goldsmith (1976)** - Autosegmental phonology framework that inspired the multi-tiered parallel structure of Delta, providing the linguistic theory underlying Hertz's framework.
