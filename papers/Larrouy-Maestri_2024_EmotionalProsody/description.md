This paper is a comprehensive 30-year literature review of emotional prosody research that synthesizes findings on the acoustic features—including pitch, duration, loudness, spectral quality, and dynamics—associated with different emotional states in speech. The authors identify key acoustic factors that distinguish emotions (e.g., high F0 and intensity for anger, low pitch and slow rate for sadness) while highlighting the persistent lack of consensus in the field due to variability in speech materials, measurement choices, cultural differences, and emotion granularity. For speech synthesis, this work provides concrete parameter profiles and implementation guidance for modulating formant synthesizers like Klatt (F0 contours, formant frequencies, spectral tilt, voice quality) to generate emotionally expressive synthetic speech.
