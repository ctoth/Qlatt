## Key Findings

### Intonation Patterns and Emotion (Chapter IV conclusion)
- Three clusters of intonation patterns identified:
  - Cluster '1...1&A': patterns 1&A 1&A, 1B 1&A, 1D 1&A, 12 1&A
  - Cluster '1...A': patterns 1A and 1EA
  - Cluster '1...3C': patterns 1&A 3C, 1B 3C, 1D 3C
- The '1&A 1&A' pattern (pitch movements at both initial and final positions) is most versatile for conveying all emotions
- Patterns ending in 'C' (fall in final position) signal emotionality - perceived as non-neutral
- Patterns ending in '2' associated with indignation
- The '12' pattern strongly associated with indignation
- The '3C' patterns negatively associated with neutral speech

### Dutch Intonation System (Chapter IV)
- Six basic intonation patterns in Dutch according to 't Hart et al.:
  - /1A/ "hat pattern"
  - /1E/ or /4A/ "valley pattern"
  - /3C/ "cap pattern"
  - /1/
  - /2/
- Two prominence-lending rises: early (L+H*) and late (L*+H) per Pierrehumbert (1980)
- The fall 'A' of the '1&A' pattern starts 80 ms after vowel onset

### Speech Rate and Emotion (Chapter V)
- **Boredom**: slowest speech (150% of neutral duration, ~0.67 relative rate)
- **Sadness**: slower than neutral (129% duration, ~0.78 rate)
- **Indignation**: slower (117% duration, ~0.85 rate)
- **Fear**: close to neutral (89% duration, 1.12 rate optimal)
- **Joy/Gladness**: similar to neutral (83% duration, faster)
- **Anger**: faster than neutral (79% duration, ~1.27 rate)
- **Neutrality**: baseline (100%)

### Accented vs Unaccented Segment Duration
- Emotional speech shows tendency to stretch accented syllables relatively more than non-accented ones
- For speech rates lower than optimal for neutrality, accented segments tend to be relatively longer
- This is particularly evident for emotions like anger, sadness, fear, and indignation

## Equations Found

### Regression equations for durational proportion of accented speech segments (page 136)
Where x = overall sentence duration (seconds), y = proportion of accented segments:

**Sentence 1 (vliegtuig):**
$$y = 0.4206 - (0.0388 \times x)$$

**Sentence 2 (kapper):**
- For $x < 1.83$: $y = 0.3246 + (0.0387 \times x)$
- Else: $y = 0.4845 - (0.0487 \times x)$

**Sentence 3 (uur):**
- For $x < 1.09$: $y = 0.3012 + (0.1026 \times x)$
- Else: $y = 0.4906 - (0.0712 \times x)$

## F0/Prosody Patterns

### Intonation Pattern Clusters and Emotion Perception
- **Neutrality**: best with '1...1&A' cluster (patterns ending in 1&A), 36.9% correct identification
- **Boredom**: best with '1...1&A' cluster, 40.7% correct; optimally realized with '3C' final pattern
- **Joy**: best with '1...A' cluster, preferably '1&A' or '5A' ending; NOT single 'A'
- **Anger**: best with '5&A' or single 'A' or 'EA' patterns, NOT '1&A' or '3C'
- **Sadness**: medium pitch level, moderate range, '3C' preferred final pattern
- **Fear**: high pitch level, large range, ends in '12' but not single 'A'
- **Indignation**: very strongly associated with '12' pattern

### Pitch Movement Timing
- Position of pitch movement in syllable defined with respect to "vowel onset moment"
- Non-prominence-lending rise '2' timing: "as late as possible in the syllable" (end of voicing)
- Fall 'C': during last 20-50 ms of phonation, F0 drops rapidly to immaterial value
- The 'A' fall in '1&A' pattern starts 80 ms after vowel onset

### Dutch Basic Pitch Movements (per 't Hart and Collier, 1975)
- Distinctive features: direction, timing relative to syllable boundary, rate of change, excursion size
- The '3' rise excursion is often larger than '1' rise
- Pitch movements can be underspecified in real speech

## Voice Quality Parameters
- Voice quality mentioned as important determinant of emotion but NOT varied in this thesis
- Referenced: Laukkanen, Vilkman, Alku, and Oskanen (1997); Cummings and Clements (1995); Scherer, Ladd, and Silverman (1984)
- Speakers may compensate for one prosodic component by using another (mutual compensation)
- One speaker (MR) used less distinctive F0 curves for boredom, relying more on speech rate

## Formant Data
[No formant data in this section - Chapter V focuses on temporal/prosodic features]

## Klatt Synthesizer Details
- Utterances were re-synthesized using analysis-resynthesis for the perception experiments
- PSOLA technique (Moulines & Laroche, 1995) used for duration manipulations
- Pitch contours generated using rule-based system (Hermes, 1990)
- All signals had constant voice quality (original neutral utterances as base)
- Intonation pattern '1&A 1&A' or '1B 1B' used as base pattern

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The first important conclusion of this study is that the intonation pattern realized on an utterance is a very important determinant of the emotion conveyed in an utterance." (page 117)

> "The choice of intonation pattern clearly appears to be relevant for the perception of emotion in speech. Some patterns appear to be more suited to convey certain emotions than others." (page 116)

> "Patterns involving a fall 'C' in the final position appear to be perceived as a signal that the utterance was not expressing neutrality." (page 116)

> "In situations in which one does not want to introduce variability by using different intonation patterns, the '1&A 1&A' pattern is the most suited intonation pattern for controlling this variation." (page 117)

> "Changes of the relative durations of linguistic units within a sentence [...] convey something about the mood of the speaker or about the circumstances under which the utterance was made." (page 132, citing Lehiste 1970)

> "The lengthening of the last syllable in an utterance is a well known temporal phenomenon (e.g., Oller, 1973; Klatt, 1975; Beckman, 1990)." (page 132)

> "Speakers seem to rely more on speech rate for the expression of some emotions than for the expression of others." (page 131)

## Implementation Notes

### Speech Rate Manipulation for TTS
1. **Baseline**: Measure neutral speech rate (syllables/second or inverse of duration)
2. **Emotion-specific scaling factors** (relative to neutral = 1.0):
   - Joy: ~1.0 (no change needed)
   - Boredom: 0.67 (slow down by 33%)
   - Anger: 1.27 (speed up by 27%)
   - Sadness: 0.78 (slow down by 22%)
   - Fear: 1.12 (speed up slightly)
   - Indignation: 0.85 (slow down by 15%)

### Accented Syllable Stretching
For emotional speech at slower rates:
- Stretch accented syllables proportionally MORE than unaccented
- At faster rates: distribution follows neutral pattern more closely
- Recommended: use regression equations from page 136 to compute proportion

### Intonation Pattern Selection
For a Klatt TTS system expressing emotion:
1. Use '1&A 1&A' as default/neutral pattern (versatile across emotions)
2. For indignation: switch to '12' pattern
3. For boredom/sadness: consider '3C' ending
4. Avoid patterns ending in 'C' for neutral speech
5. The fall 'A' should start ~80 ms after vowel onset of accented syllable

### PSOLA-style Duration Manipulation
- Duration manipulations performed BEFORE applying intonation pattern
- Keep last syllable unchanged (to avoid interference with final lengthening)
- Voice quality kept constant - manipulate only duration and F0
