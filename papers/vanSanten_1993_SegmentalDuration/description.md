This paper presents a speaker-dependent segmental duration prediction system that uses sums-of-products models to capture complex interactions between linguistic factors (stress, consonant class, position) affecting how long sounds are held in speech. Van Santen develops 42 separate models organized by phonetic category (vowels, intervocalic consonants, non-intervocalic consonants) that achieve 0.93 correlation with observed durations and significantly outperform Klatt-style multiplicative rules in listener preference testing (73% preference, 60% of sentences rated significantly better). This approach directly addresses the limitations of simpler duration rules in speech synthesis by modeling how stress, place of articulation, and phrasal position interact to modulate segment timing in natural speech.
