This paper presents a pitch-synchronous formant extraction method using group-delay based glottal closure instant (GCI) detection to accurately track time-varying vocal tract characteristics in voiced speech. The key contribution is a multicycle covariance method that separates open and closed glottal phase formant estimates, reducing error by an order of magnitude compared to block-based analysis, especially for high-frequency voices. The work is relevant for speech synthesis because it demonstrates that formant parameters vary significantly within pitch periods and across transitions, informing how Klatt-style synthesizers should update parameters for realistic voice modeling.
