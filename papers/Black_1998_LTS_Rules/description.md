This paper presents a general framework for automatically building letter-to-sound (LTS) rules from pronunciation lexicons using CART decision trees, enabling TTS systems to synthesize out-of-vocabulary words. The key contribution is a two-stage approach combining letter-phone alignment (via hand-seeded allowables tables or automatic EM-based epsilon scattering) with CART tree training, achieving 74.56% word accuracy on British English and demonstrating generalization across multiple languages. LTS rules are essential for robust speech synthesis because they allow TTS systems to handle the infinite space of possible input words despite having finite pronunciation lexicons, making this work foundational for practical TTS deployment.
