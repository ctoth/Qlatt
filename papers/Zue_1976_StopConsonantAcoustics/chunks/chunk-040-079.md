## Key Findings

### Linear Prediction Analysis (Chapter 3.1)
- **All-pole model**: Vocal tract transfer function typically has 5-6 complex pole pairs up to 5 kHz
- Adding two real poles for glottal source and radiation losses gives p = 12-14 for 10 kHz sampling
- Linear prediction analysis captures essential spectral characteristics of nasals and fricatives (Zue 1972)
- **Autocorrelation method preferred** over covariance method - provides smoother frame-to-frame spectral variation due to windowing

### Analysis Parameters
- Speech band-limited to 5 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz, 12 bits
- 12.8 ms Hanning window used for short-time spectra
- New spectrum computed every 5 milliseconds
- Linear prediction relatively insensitive to pitch variations when F0 < 200 Hz

### Stop Consonant Temporal Terminology (Chapter 4.1)
Key phases defined for stops in e'CVCe context:
1. **Closure phase**: Absence of sound energy (unvoiced stops) or small amount at very low frequencies (voiced stops due to vocal cord vibration)
2. **Release/Burst**: Sudden increase of sound energy at all frequencies, with frequency characteristics depending on constriction position
3. **Aspiration** (voiceless stops only): Noise source at glottis, excites all but lowest resonance
4. **Frication** (voiced stops): May continue voicing through release, with frication noise

### Key Temporal Definitions
- **Closure interval**: Measured from end of preceding schwa (or /s/ in clusters) to release
- **Release**: Marked by sharp increase in acoustic energy; onset of burst
- **VOT (Voice-Onset Time)**: Duration of release interval for both voiced and voiceless stops
  - For voiced stops: VOT measures release interval duration
  - For voiceless stops: VOT is really a measure of burst duration (should be interpreted with caution)
- Boundary between frication and aspiration difficult to determine due to acoustic overlap

### Voiced vs Voiceless Stop Differences
- **Voiced stops (/b,d,g/)**: Often maintain voicing during closure interval; voicing may continue through plosive release
- **Voiceless aspirated stops (/p,t,k/)**: No spontaneous voicing before release; vocal cords not adjusted for vibration; as constriction opens, noise generated at glottis creates aspirated sound
- Aspiration noise source is close to glottis, excites all but lowest resonance of vocal tract
- Subglottal formants frequently appear during aspiration (Fant et al. 1972)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **VOT Parameters by Place of Articulation**:
   - Voiced labial /b/: ~13 ms VOT
   - Voiced alveolar /d/: ~19 ms VOT
   - Voiced velar /g/: ~30 ms VOT
   - Pattern: VOT increases from front to back (labial < alveolar < velar)

2. **Burst vs Aspiration Boundary**:
   - Difficult to determine acoustically - there is always overlap
   - Burst energy concentrated in front cavity resonances (place-dependent)
   - Aspiration energy excites all but lowest resonance (source at glottis)
   - Subglottal formants may appear during aspiration

3. **Voiced Stop Characteristics**:
   - May maintain voicing through closure and release
   - Frication noise follows burst
   - Voicing for following vowel starts quickly after release

4. **Voiceless Stop Characteristics**:
   - No voicing during closure
   - Release has frication + aspiration phases
   - Aspiration shows formant transitions traceable to following vowel
   - VOT > 40 msec for 95%+ of tokens

5. **Analysis Window**:
   - 12.8 ms Hanning window optimal for LP analysis
   - Update every 5 ms for adequate temporal resolution at stop release

6. **Burst Frequency and Place**:
   - Coronal stops (/t,d/): burst frequency typically > 3000 Hz
   - Can be used as a place-of-articulation cue

## Quotes Worth Preserving

### On Linear Prediction Analysis (page 40-41)
> "The number of poles, p, is determined by the sampling frequency as well as our knowledge of the speech production mechanism. For example, there exist in general 5 to 6 complex pole pairs for the vocal tract transfer function up to 5 kHz. Adding two real poles for the combined effect of the glottal source and the radiation losses, we arrived at a value of p between 12 and 14 for the speech signal sampled at 10 kHz."

### On Autocorrelation vs Covariance Method (page 42)
> "The autocorrelation method has the advantage of smoother spectral variation from frame to frame, a direct consequence of windowing the speech."

### On Stop Release Acoustics (page 74)
> "During the closure, air pressure continues to build up behind the constriction and is released finally by a sudden opening of the constriction. The release is usually accompanied by a burst of frication noise as air rushes through the narrow constriction, creating turbulence noise."

### On VOT Definition (page 77)
> "For the remainder of this chapter, the term voice-onset time (VOT) will be used to designate the duration of the release interval for voiced and voiceless stops alike. For the unvoiced stops, voice-onset time is really a measure of the burst duration, and should be interpreted with caution."

### On Aspiration Characteristics (page 75)
> "The noise source for aspiration is situated close to the glottis, and therefore all except the lowest resonance of the vocal tract are being excited. Movements of the articulators and the resulting formant motions can, for the most part, be observed on the spectrogram during aspiration."

### On Burst/Aspiration Boundary (page 77-78)
> "Although the articulatory gesture and the positions of the noise sources for burst and aspiration are quite different, the acoustic manifestation of these two phases of the stop release are not always so unambiguous. In fact, there is invariably a certain degree of overlap in the acoustic cues, making the effort to distinguish them extremely difficult."

### On Subglottal Formants (page 75)
> "Another characteristic of aspiration is that there is a certain degree of coupling between the supra- and sub-glottal cavities, depending on the opening at the glottis. Subglottal formants [Fant et al. 1972] frequently appear during aspiration."
