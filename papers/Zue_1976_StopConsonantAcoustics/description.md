This thesis presents a comprehensive acoustic analysis of English stop consonants (/p,t,k,b,d,g/) measured across 1,728 utterances in controlled CV and CCV contexts, establishing precise measurements for voice onset time (VOT), burst frequency, and burst amplitude that reveal systematic patterns by place of articulation and vowel context. The key findings demonstrate that labial bursts are 12 dB weaker than dental/velar bursts, voiceless stops exhibit constant total duration (~150 ms) with inversely related closure and VOT components, velar burst frequencies show strong vowel-dependency while dentals remain relatively invariant, and /s/-clusters dramatically reduce VOT to voice-like values. These acoustic measurements provide essential reference data for implementing realistic stop consonant synthesis in formant synthesizers, establishing the empirical basis for VOT timing rules, burst amplitude scaling, and context-dependent burst frequency adjustments that distinguish stop place of articulation.
