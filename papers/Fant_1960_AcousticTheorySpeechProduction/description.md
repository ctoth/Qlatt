Gunnar Fant's foundational 1960 text establishes the source-filter model of speech production and provides the complete mathematical framework, transfer function equations, and empirical formant data for implementing formant synthesizers. The book presents comprehensive acoustic theory covering the glottal voice source, vocal tract transfer functions, radiation characteristics, and detailed acoustic parameters for vowels, consonants, and articulation-acoustic mappings. This work provides the theoretical foundation for all modern formant synthesizers including Klatt's cascade/parallel architecture, bandwidth calculations, nasalization pole-zero pairs, and voice source spectrum models.
