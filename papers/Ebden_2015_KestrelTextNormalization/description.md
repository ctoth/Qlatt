Kestrel is Google's production text-to-speech text normalization system that processes raw text through a two-phase pipeline: tokenization/classification (using WFSTs to recognize non-standard words and convert them to structured protocol buffers) followed by verbalization (converting those structures to in-lexicon words with language-specific word order and morphology). The key innovation is separating these phases to avoid expensive FST branching for reordering phenomena like "$200" → "two hundred dollars"; instead, protocol buffers represent structured semantic information flexibly without linear order constraints, allowing efficient language-dependent reordering at verbalization time. Deployed across 19 languages on servers and hundreds of millions of Android devices, Kestrel achieves 91.3% accuracy on English text normalization and demonstrates practical solutions for resource-constrained mobile deployment and morphologically complex languages like Russian, making it directly applicable to improving Qlatt's text-to-phoneme frontend.
