# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

A set of 66 vowels acoustically similar to /ae/ have been synthesized by adding together sinusoidal harmonics of the appropriate frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Subjects were asked to estimate the psychophysical distance between each stimulus and a reference vowel in a 300-trial randomized test. Normalized subjective distance scores have been computed for stimulus manipulations involving formant frequencies, formant bandwidths, spectral tilt, phase relations among harmonics, vocal tract length, and filtering passband/stopband. The data can be used to develop better spectral measures of psychophysical similarity among vowels. In addition, large perceptual effects of phase manipulations (in particular, the observation that random phase lead to a harsh "aperiodic" sensation) implicates temporal processing of neural spike information as the most likely mechanism for pitch estimation during speech perception.

## Our Interpretation

This paper investigates which acoustic features listeners actually use to perceive vowel quality by synthesizing 66 variations of the vowel /ae/ with different acoustic manipulations. The authors found that listeners are extremely sensitive to formant frequency changes (about 20 times more sensitive than bandwidth changes), and surprisingly, that random phase relationships between harmonics create a harsh, aperiodic sensation—suggesting the auditory system relies on temporal patterns in neural firing for pitch perception. For speech synthesis, this tells us that precise control over formant frequencies and phase relationships is critical for natural vowel quality, while exact bandwidth matching may be less important than previously thought.
