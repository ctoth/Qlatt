## Key Concepts

### Nasalization Effects
- Intensity reduction of F1 is the major perceptive cue for nasalization
- Increasing bandwidth B1 creates apparent nasal quality
- Nasalization may compensate for too neutral tongue position when articulating [a]
- Vibrato neutralizes nasal quality in synthesized vowels

### Liquids [l] and [r]
- Can be treated acoustically like vowels (no shunting side chambers introducing anti-resonances)
- Laterals [l] introduce anti-resonance (zero function) but less important than nasals
- Non-palatalized vs palatalized distinction: tongue back position relative to pharynx
- Non-palatalized: secondary place of articulation at/below uvula (double Helmholtz resonator)
- Palatalized: wide unobstructed pharynx, gradual narrowing toward articulatory constriction

### Fricatives, Affricates, and Stops
- Common denominator: resonator system with prescribed F-pattern (formant frequencies)
- Source location and spectrum envelope influence relative intensity levels
- Glottis opening raises F1 and increases damping
- Voiced vs voiceless fricatives: primarily temporal intensity modulation difference
- Voice source is primary for /j/ and /v/ perception; noise is secondary

### Stop Classification System
- 0 = voiced occlusion
- I = initial transient of explosion
- II = fricative sound intervals
- III = aspirated or mixed aspirated and fricative sound intervals

## Equations Found

### Anti-resonance Zero Frequency (Lateral Passage)
$$
f_z = \frac{c}{4l_s}
$$
Where:
- $f_z$ = zero frequency (Hz)
- $c$ = velocity of sound (~35000 cm/s)
- $l_s$ = effective length of shunting system (cm)

For lateral [l]: $l_s = 4.4$ cm gives zero at 2000 c/s

### Pole-Zero Filter Function (Fricatives)
$$
|1 - \frac{f^2 - jfB_z}{F_z^2}|
$$
Where:
- $F_z$ = zero frequency
- $B_z$ = bandwidth of zero
- $f$ = frequency

At frequencies above $F_z$: approaches +12 dB/octave rise
(See Eq. 1.3-12)

### Mode Spectrum Transfer Function
$$
H_4(s) \text{ of Eq. A.34-4 and 6}
$$
The -6 dB/octave average slope of explosion interval corresponds to 3 poles minus 2 zeros near origin.

## Vocal Tract Models

### Liquid [l] Configuration
- Total system length including mouth shunt: $l_{tot} = 22$ cm
- Average formant spacing: c/2l_tot = 800 c/s
- Close formant spacing (5 formants from 2250-5000 c/s, ~700 c/s spacing) causes "ringing" quality
- Lateral outlet extends from posterior molar teeth to tongue apex

### Liquid [r] Configuration
- Non-palatalized: secondary articulation at uvular region (double Helmholtz resonator)
- Palatalized: wide pharynx, narrowing toward alveolar ridge
- Periodically variable with trill frequency of [r]

### Fricative/Stop Front Cavity Models (Fig. 2.6-11)
Three simplified models for idealized stop/fricative analysis:

**A. Labials and Labiodentals:**
- No resonator in front of constriction
- Source close to center of constriction
- Flat spectrum envelope, even energy distribution (0-10000 c/s)
- Lip cavity resonance: 6000-7000 c/s

**B. Dentals:**
- No appreciable resonator in front of constriction
- Constriction channel provides half-wavelength resonance at ~5500 c/s
- High-pass characteristics, zero at ~3500 c/s accentuates level above 4000 c/s
- Main spectral peak: 4000-7000 c/s

**C. Velars, Palatals, etc.:**
- Large resonator in front of constriction
- Fundamental resonance is main spectral determinant
- Lower frequency than main peak of dentals
- Difference between [k] and [t]: quarter-wavelength vs half-wavelength resonance

### Source Location Effects
- Labials: source at x = 0.5 cm from front end
- Dentals: source at x = 1 cm from front end
- Velars [k],[k,]: source in middle of tongue constriction
- Source shift from teeth to tongue channel: minimal effect on F1-F3, reduces high frequency

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Fricative Source Characteristics:**
   - Standard source spectrum: -6 dB/octave (constant velocity) or -12 dB/octave (constant spectrum level)
   - High source resistance for fricatives/affricates: derived from Eq. A.2-10 with v = 6000 cm/sec, A = 0.08 cm^2
   - Source resistance not critical for spectrum shape essentials

2. **Stop Burst Modeling:**
   - Explosion spectrum: -6 dB/octave average slope (3 poles minus 2 zeros)
   - Very narrow constriction (0.16 cm^2 minimum) during occlusion
   - Source resistance 0.25 gc standard for calculations
   - Glottis resistance 5 gc during phonation

3. **Place of Articulation Effects:**
   - Labials: flat spectrum, energy even 0-10000 c/s, lip cavity resonance 6000-7000 c/s
   - Dentals: high-pass, zero at ~3500 c/s, main peak 4000-7000 c/s
   - Velars/Palatals: lower main peak than dentals, quarter-wavelength vs half-wavelength

4. **Formant Transitions:**
   - Rate of cross-sectional area change: 5-20 cm^2/sec
   - Stylized spectrogram time scale expanded 2-8x from actual
   - Labial F2 transition completed at 0.2 cm^2 lip opening
   - Major labial transition within ~15 msec

5. **Limiting F-pattern After Stop Release:**
   - F1 = 400 c/s, F2 = 1750 c/s, F3 = 2600 c/s
   - Corresponds to slightly rounded, half-open front vowel

6. **Anti-resonance Zeros:**
   - For [s]: zeros at 700, 950, 1300, 3000, 3900, 4900 c/s (from teeth source)
   - For dentals: first zero at ~3500 c/s
   - Pole-zero pairs from F1-associated zeros trade at origin

7. **Voiced Stop Considerations:**
   - More representative of voiced stops than voiceless (5 gc glottis provides too low formant damping at low frequencies)
   - Open glottis: 0.33 gc matched impedance gives too large damping in F1 region
   - Actual impedance lies between 0.33 and 5 gc

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The conclusions reached by Delattre (1954) and House and Stevens (1956), that the intensity reduction of the first formant is the major perceptive cue for nasalization, have been verified by experiments with the formant-synthesis speaking machine OVE."

> "Acoustically, the common denominator of all sounds produced from a resonator system of a prescribed configuration is the particular set of formant frequencies of the vocal tract, i.e., the F-pattern."

> "The role of the noise components of voiced fricatives, affricates, and stops should not be overestimated. The secondary role of the noise in the perception of the phoneme /j/ has motivated its classification as a glide; Halle (1954)."

> "From an acoustical point of view, when stationary sound spectra only are considered, there is no essential difference between an unvoiced fricative [f] and a fricative consonant [s] of the same articulation or between the corresponding voiced sounds [r] and [z]."

> "The physical mechanism underlying the production of turbulent sounds, either in simplified mechanical models or in speech, is not sufficiently well understood for a rational prediction of the exact location and extent of a source along the length coordinate of the cavity system."

> "In extreme simplification these resonator characteristics can be stated as:
> [f] No or very high resonance frequency;
> [s] High resonance frequency or rather high cutoff frequency of a high-pass filter;
> [s] Single resonance frequency lower than for [f] or [s]."

> "The net effect of this clustering of crosses and circles near the origin is 3 poles minus 2 zeros; there is a reduction to a single pole which conditions the -6 dB/octave average slope of the explosion interval of a stop sound."

> "It is thus often seen that the major part of a labial transition is completed within about 15 msec."
