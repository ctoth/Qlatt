## Key Findings

### Consonant Sequences Across Syllable Boundaries (10.2)
- In two-stop sequences (e.g., /pt/ in "up to"), F2 and F3 show downward movement during closure, but there is no acoustic evidence for the labial release - the alveolar closure forms before labial release
- For /sm/ cluster, velopharyngeal port opens just after labial closure and closes just after labial release, creating brief nasal murmur duration
- Consonant sequence durations at syllable boundary are greater than single consonant durations in intervocalic position
- In /sw/ clusters, the labiovelar glide following /s/ causes front-cavity resonance to decrease from about 3.5 to 2.5 kHz within the fricative

### Voicing Modifications in Consonant Sequences
- When examining /z#k/ vs /z#j/ sequences: the voicing characteristics of following consonant extend backward and influence preceding fricative
- When following consonant is voiced: significant glottal vibration amplitude maintained through fricative
- When following consonant is voiceless: additional 10 dB reduction in glottal amplitude at end of fricative, noise component reduced by 5-10 dB relative to voiced environment
- Time from fricative to voiceless stop release: about 120 ms
- Glottis returns to modal configuration 20-30 ms after /k/ onset
- Glottal vibration onset after release: about 50-60 ms
- Total glottal opening-closing movement: somewhat greater than 200 ms (consistent with 200-250 ms for complete modal-to-abduction cycle)

### Laryngeal and Pharyngeal Adjustments (Figure 10.7)
- For voiceless stop /k/: greater glottal spreading begins early in fricative for /z/, shortly after time 0
- For voiced stop /j/: slackening continues throughout consonantal interval
- Intraoral pressure builds up to about 8 cm H2O for voiceless stop
- Result: reduced amplitude of frication noise in /z/ before voiced affricate
- Voicing feature modifications extend over time intervals of 200 to 250 ms

### Effects of Context on Vowel Production (10.3)
- Time for tongue body to move from backed to fronted position: about 100 ms
- Complete movement cycle (back to front to back): 200-300 ms range
- If release of initial consonant to closure of postvocalic consonant < 200-300 ms, consonants influence the vowel throughout its length
- In rapid speech, vowel durations often shorter than 200 ms, so vowels significantly influenced by adjacent consonants
- Average vowel durations in /h-d/ context: 150-350 ms (lax vowels at lower end)

### Consonant Influence on Vowel Formants (Figure 10.8, Table 10.1)
- F1 and F2 at vowel midpoint plotted for eight vowels in three consonant contexts:
  - Labials (p, b, f, v): open circles
  - Postdentals (theta, s, z, t, d, ch, j): triangles
  - Velars (k, g): squares
  - Null (isolated/h-d): filled dots
- Substantial F2 undershoot for some consonant contexts
- Example: lax vowel /I/ surrounded by tongue blade consonants shows F2 about 200 Hz lower than in null context

**Table 10.1 - Formant frequencies (Hz) for vowel /^/ in "cover" and "justice":**

| Word | Female F1 | Female F2 | Female F3 | Male F1 | Male F2 | Male F3 |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| cover | 750 | 1320 | 2810 | 600 | 1050 | 2530 |
| justice | 630 | 1550 | 3540 | 560 | 1310 | 2560 |

- F2 difference between words: 200-300 Hz
- F1 difference (female speaker): constraint that /j/ places on tongue body height causes anomaly of high F3 in "justice"

### Reduced Vowels (Schwa) - Section 10.4
- Reduced vowels (schwa) not specified for feature [back]
- Tongue body position not constrained, so F2 strongly influenced by adjacent vowels/consonants
- Short duration makes them susceptible to contextual modification

**Table 10.2 - Schwa formant frequencies (Hz) in "pass a dip" and "rub a book":**

| Utterance | Female F1 | Female F2 | Female F3 | Male F1 | Male F2 | Male F3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| pass a dip | 494 | 1785 | 3513 | 423 | 1491 | 2624 |
| rub a book | 410 | 1071 | 2908 | 488 | 912 | 2474 |

- Duration of schwa: about 50 ms in these examples
- First vowel in "monopoly": 50 ms; third vowel (from /p/ release to /l/ closure): 30 ms
- In "classical": middle vowel has just one glottal pulse for the vowel
- Articulator movement for schwa: 130-140 ms (shorter than 200-250 ms for full vowels)

### Schwa Acoustic Characteristics
- Maximum oral opening during schwa: about 0.3 cm^2 (much less than full vowels)
- Given F1 around 450 Hz in vowel and 0.3 cm^2 cross-sectional area, uniform tube of 0.7 cm effective constriction length yields calculated F1 of about 330 Hz (based on Helmholtz formula, with correction for yielding walls)
- F1 bandwidth expected to be large given appreciable glottal opening
- Glottal opening has double peak due to changes in supraglottal pressure
- Reduced vowel nasalization: when between nasal consonants, shows widened F1 formant leading to reduced overall amplitude

## Equations Found

### Acoustic Mass of Tube
$$M_A = \rho \ell / A$$
where:
- $\rho$ = density of air
- $\ell$ = length of tube
- $A$ = cross-sectional area of tube

### Effective Mechanical Compliance (Chapter 2 note)
$$C_L = C_1 C_c / (C_1 + C_c)$$
where:
- $C_1$ = mechanical compliance of lower mass
- $C_c$ = coupling compliance between two masses

| Glottis modal return time | - | 20-30 | ms | After onset of glottal vibration for /k/ |
| Voice onset time (VOT) | - | 50-60 | ms | After release for voiceless stop |

### Front-Cavity Resonance Changes
- /sw/ cluster: front-cavity resonance decreases from about 3.5 kHz to 2.5 kHz during fricative

## Rules/Algorithms

### Consonant Sequence Articulation
1. In two-stop sequences across syllable boundary, the first stop closure overlaps with second stop closure (no release burst for first stop)
2. Place of articulation for first consonant signaled by formant transitions at closure
3. Place of articulation for second consonant signaled by acoustic events at release
4. Total consonant sequence duration > single intervocalic consonant duration

### Voicing Assimilation in Consonant Sequences
1. Voicing characteristics of following consonant influence preceding consonant
2. When following consonant is voiced: maintain glottal vibration through fricative
3. When following consonant is voiceless: begin glottal spreading early in preceding fricative
4. Adjustments extend over 200-250 ms time intervals

### Vowel Reduction Rules
1. If vowel duration < 200-300 ms, adjacent consonants influence vowel throughout its length
2. Schwa formants determined primarily by adjacent consonant context (since tongue body not constrained)
3. Alveolar consonant context: tongue blade fronted -> higher F2
4. Labial consonant context: minimal tongue body constraint -> lower F2
5. Very short schwa (<50 ms) may show overlap of consonant release with closure of following consonant

### Glottalization Rules
- Syllable-final alveolar stop before syllable-initial velar consonant often produced with glottalization
- Alveolar closure may be omitted, leaving only glottalization as evidence
- Tongue body articulator for following velar becomes articulator for preceding consonant place

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The acoustic representation of the adjacent segment cannot carry the transitions that are normally observed when that segment is a vowel. In the case of a vowel segment, there can be modifications of formant frequencies or of attributes related to the glottal or velopharyngeal configurations due to the influence of adjacent consonants or nearby vowels, particularly if the vowel is relatively short." (p. 580)

> "Several general observations can be made from the examples of phonetic modifications given in this chapter. One is that the detailed acoustic attributes of vowel and consonant segments depend on the environment in which the segments occur." (p. 580-581)

> "These acoustic consequences and their representation in the peripheral auditory system can be predicted from articulatory-acoustic-auditory relations of the type described in chapters 1 through 4. Finally, although it can be argued that words are stored in memory in terms of segments and features, a speaker may modify some of these features in casual speech. However, there are strong constraints on the types of feature modifications that are allowed. A listener must resort to knowledge of the language at levels above the segment and feature to recover the words from such casually produced utterances." (p. 581)

> "The time interval of 100 to 150 ms, and consequently this influence will encompass a greater region of a vowel when the vowel is relatively short. Slower speech tends to have longer vowels and hence the effect of adjacent consonants is reduced, particularly near the centers of the vowels." (p. 574)

## Implementation Notes

### For Formant Synthesizer (Klatt)
1. **Consonant sequence timing**: When implementing consonant clusters across syllable boundaries, the total duration should exceed single consonant duration. Consider overlapping closures for stop sequences.

2. **Voicing assimilation**: Implement anticipatory voicing/devoicing that extends 200-250 ms into preceding segment. Adjust:
   - AV (voicing amplitude)
   - AH (aspiration)
   - Noise source amplitudes (AF)
   - Vocal fold stiffness parameters

3. **Reduced vowel parameters**:
   - Duration: 30-50 ms typical
   - F1: determined by oral opening (~330-500 Hz)
   - F2: strongly influenced by adjacent consonant place
   - F1 bandwidth: larger than full vowels due to glottal opening
   - Consider nasalization between nasal consonants (widened B1)

4. **Context-dependent formant targets**:
   - Alveolar context: raise F2 for following/preceding vowel
   - Labial context: minimal F2 modification
   - Velar context: lower F2 for back vowels, raise for front vowels
   - Implement gradual transitions over 100-150 ms

5. **Glottalization implementation**:
   - For syllable-final stops before velar consonants
   - Can substitute for alveolar closure entirely
   - Manifests as low-frequency irregular vibration (AV with very low F0 and high jitter)

6. **Intraoral pressure modeling**:
   - Builds to ~8 cm H2O for voiceless stops
   - Affects voicing amplitude during closure
   - Models in Figure 10.7 show pressure trajectories for different voicing conditions

### Duration Rules
- Tongue body movement back-to-front: 100 ms minimum
- Full cycle (back-front-back): 200-300 ms
- If vowel shorter than these values, consonant effects persist through entire vowel
- Implement coarticulation that is inversely proportional to vowel duration

### Key Timing Parameters for TTS
| Event | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Schwa duration (running speech) | 30-50 ms |
| Minimal vowel for formant target | 200-300 ms |
| Anticipatory voicing adjustment | 200-250 ms |
| Stop closure to release (following voiceless) | 120 ms |
| VOT for /k/ after /z/ | 50-60 ms |
| Glottis modal return after stop onset | 20-30 ms |
