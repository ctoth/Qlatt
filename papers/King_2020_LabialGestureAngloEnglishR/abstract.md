# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This paper presents acoustic and articulatory data from prevocalic /r/ in the non-rhotic variety of English spoken in England, Anglo-English. Although traditional descriptions suggest that Anglo-English /r/ is produced using a tip-up tongue configuration, ultrasound data from 24 speakers show similar patterns of lingual variation to those reported in rhotic varieties, with a continuum of possible tongue shapes from bunched to retroflex. However, the number of Anglo-English speakers using exclusively tip-up variants is higher than that reported in American English across all phonetic contexts. It is generally agreed that English /r/ may be labialised, but the exact contribution of the lips has yet to be explored. Lip camera data reveal significantly more lip protrusion in bunched tongue configurations than retroflex ones. These results indicate that the differing degrees of lip protrusion may contribute to maintaining a stable acoustic output across the different tongue shapes. An articulatory-acoustic trading relation between the sublingual space and the degree of lip protrusion is proposed. Finally, we suggest that Anglo-English /r/ has a specific lip posture which differs from that of /w/. We relate the development of such a posture to Anglo-English speakers' exposure to labiodental variants and to the pressure to maintain a perceptual contrast between /r/ and /w/.

## Our Interpretation

This paper investigates how English speakers in England produce the /r/ sound, finding that they use multiple tongue positions (bunched to retroflex) similar to American English, but with more retroflex variants overall. The key finding is that lip protrusion varies with tongue shape and following vowel context, suggesting that speakers use lip movement as a compensation strategy to maintain a stable acoustic output. This articulatory-acoustic trading relationship between sublingual space and lip protrusion is novel and relevant for understanding how different articulatory configurations can produce acoustically consistent /r/ sounds across speakers and contexts.
