# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Just over fifty years ago, Lisker and Abramson proposed a straightforward measure of acoustic differences among stop consonants of different voicing categories, Voice Onset Time (VOT). Since that time, hundreds of studies have used this method. Here, we review the original definition of VOT, propose some extensions to the definition, and discuss some problematic cases. We propose a set of terms for the most important aspects of VOT and a set of Praat labels that could provide some consistency for future cross-study analyses. Although additions of other aspects of realization of voicing distinctions (F0, amplitude, duration of voicelessness) could be considered, they are rejected as adding too much complexity for what has turned out to be one of the most frequently used metrics in phonetics and phonology.

## Our Interpretation

This paper reviews and extends Voice Onset Time (VOT), the acoustic measure of timing between stop release and voice onset that distinguishes voiced from voiceless consonants. The key contribution is proposing standardized terminology and Praat labeling conventions (VDCLO, VLCLO, REL, ASP) for consistent VOT measurement across studies. For speech synthesis, understanding VOT is essential for correctly modeling stop consonant voicing distinctions - the three main categories (voicing lead ~-100ms, short lag ~0-25ms, long lag/aspirated ~50-100ms) directly inform how to parameterize closure duration and aspiration timing in formant synthesizers.
