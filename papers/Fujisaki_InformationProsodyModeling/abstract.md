# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Starting from the author's view on the process of information manifestation in the tonal features of speech, this paper emphasizes the importance of objective and quantitative modeling in the study of these features. It then describes a model for the process of fundamental frequency control of speech that has been originally proposed and established for Japanese, and explains the physiological and physical evidences on which the model is based. Application of the model for generation of F0 contours of languages other than Japanese is then described, indicating how the original model can be modified and extended to cover those features that are not found in Japanese. The underlying mechanisms responsible for production of these features are also discussed.

## Our Interpretation

The paper advocates for mathematical modeling of speech prosody rather than purely descriptive approaches, presenting the "Fujisaki model" which decomposes F0 contours into phrase and accent components controlled by impulse and step commands respectively. The model has a physiological basis in laryngeal muscle mechanics and has been validated across 14 languages, requiring only changes to command patterns (not the underlying response functions) to handle different languages including tone languages like Chinese and Thai. For speech synthesis, this provides a principled way to generate natural-sounding F0 contours from linguistic structure rather than relying on ad-hoc rules.
