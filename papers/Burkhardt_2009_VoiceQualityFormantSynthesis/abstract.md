# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

We describe an approach to simulate different phonation types, following John Laver's terminology, by means of a hybrid (rule-based and unit concatenating) formant synthesizer. Different voice qualities were generated by following hints from the literature and applying the revised KLGLOTT88 model. Within a listener perception experiment, we show that the phonation types get distinguished by the listeners and lead to emotional impression as predicted by literature. The synthesis system and its source code, as well as audio samples can be downloaded at http://emoSyn.syntheticspeech.de/.

## Our Interpretation

This paper provides concrete formulas for modifying Klatt synthesizer parameters to produce different voice qualities (breathy, tense, whispery, creaky, falsetto) using the KLSYN88 glottal source model. The key contribution is a rule-based system where each phonation type is controlled by a single "rate" parameter (0-100%) that systematically adjusts OQ, TL, AV, AH, formant bandwidths, and other parameters. For speech synthesis with emotional expression, this provides actionable parameter recipes validated through listener perception experiments showing the phonation types convey expected emotional impressions.
