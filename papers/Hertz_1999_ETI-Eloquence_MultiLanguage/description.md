This paper describes the Delta System architecture for multi-language text-to-speech synthesis, which separates language-universal components (timing templates, coarticulation patterns, voice filters) from language-specific components (phoneme inventories, formant targets, duration rules) to enable scalable TTS development across 9 languages with shared code infrastructure.

Key contributions include a phone-and-transition segmentation model based on F2 patterns, the acoustic nucleus concept for syllable-based timing, and a universal parameter alignment template that positions formants at phone edges, voicing amplitude at nucleus boundaries, and F0 values relative to intonational phrases using the Pierrehumbert model.

This work is essential for speech synthesis because it demonstrates how to build maintainable multi-language TTS systems by identifying genuinely universal phonetic principles (transition durations, coarticulation rules, nucleus duration trading relationships) rather than duplicating code for each language variation.
