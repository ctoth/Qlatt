This paper presents a method for quantifying the perceptual relevance of variations in glottal-pulse parameters (specifically LF model R-parameters: return phase ratio, symmetry quotient, and open quotient) using excitation pattern distance (EPD) derived from cochlear modeling. The study establishes that 4.3 dB EPD corresponds to one just-noticeable difference (JND) across diverse listening conditions and provides a quadratic approximation (Q) that enables analytical computation of which parameter directions produce maximum/minimum perceptual sensitivity. These findings are critical for speech synthesis because they reveal that return phase (Ra) has the highest perceptual impact on voice quality, allowing synthesizers to prioritize parameter control and use a universal perceptual threshold to determine whether voice quality variations are audible to listeners.
