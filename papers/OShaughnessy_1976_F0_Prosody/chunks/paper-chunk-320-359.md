## Key Findings

### Declination Lines
- The lower declination line for JA's speech was in the region of approximately 95-110 Hz (the BOR)
- Declination line slope estimate: "3% every 100 msec at the start of an utterance, with the rate dropping exponentially to 0.5% after 5 sec" ('t Hart & Cohen)
- Mattingly: declination line falling rate of "one semitone every 320 msec"
- Swedish: "sentence intonation" described as "a linear fall from 120 Hz to 90 Hz"
- At clause boundaries, declination lines were 'reset' to higher F0 levels

### Sub-Contour (SC) Shape - The Basic Accent Pattern
- F0 in the SC starts at a medium-low level, rises rapidly on the AS (accented syllable) to a peak, and then falls to a value lower than where it started
- The shape of the F0 fall is roughly that of a 'dying' exponential: falling rapidly at first, then more slowly, and finally 'bottoming out' at a low level in the BOR
- A typical F0 pattern after a peak of 151 Hz: drop of -13 Hz to the start of the vowel, then continued fall of -15 Hz during the vowel portion
- Sharp, deep F0 falls = 'primary' accents; slight falls = 'secondary' accents

### Bottom Ordinary Range (BOR)
- For male speakers, the BOR was located around 90-110 Hz, about 10-15 Hz wide
- The center value of the BORs was about 93 Hz (JA and KS slightly higher, ML, DO, DK lower)
- Parenthetical expressions and low-key 'monotone' speech have F0 which often resides in this BOR
- F0 usually did not fall below the BOR until the very end of a Tune A utterance, when F0 fell to an utterance-minimum about 10-15 Hz below the BOR

### Anticipation Effect - Initial F0 Peak Model
- The F0 range used by a speaker (between 1 and 2.5 octaves) varies from utterance to utterance depending on a number of factors
- One factor is 'anticipation': speaker uses larger F0 range for longer sentences
- Base peak level of 152 Hz for a basic 2-phrase utterance with a single-noun initial NP
- For each additional 'phrase' (up to a total of 5), add +12 Hz to the initial peak
- The addition of 1 or 2 accented words to the initial NP itself counts as one 'phrase'
- Anticipation effect saturates at about 188 Hz (for JA) with the addition of a sixth 'phrase'
- Unvoiced consonants: add an 'unvoiced boost' to initial F0 peak (+19 Hz observed for words like "quick," "shrill")

### Proximity Phenomena - Separation
- Accent on a syllable gets decreased as the number of USs before it increased and after it increased (ceteris paribus)
- Two ASs competing for accent enter into a 'trading relationship' if they are not sufficiently 'separated' from each other by a number of USs
- If two or more USs occurred both before and after an AS, it was considered 'well-separated' from other accents
- Back-to-back F0 rises push F0 higher: the rise accent was found almost entirely in the nucleus rise, with very little prior F0 jump

### Accent Alternation (Rhythm Rules)
- English has often been called 'stressed-timed,' in that stressed syllables are supposedly spaced at equal durational intervals
- There is a tendency in English for ASs to be longer than USs
- Bolinger: "accented and unaccented syllables tend to alternate with each other" and English has "a general tendency . . . to have prominent syllables flanked by subdued ones"
- 'Accent shift' can occur where the AS of an accented word will sometimes shift around within the word in response to pressure of other nearby ASs

### Competition Effect
- When a sentence has several ASs, each is likely to receive less accent than if fewer were present
- American English has "a definite tendency toward smaller but more peaks and valleys in the melody curves of longer sentences"
- The occurrence of an AS has an inhibitive effect on the occurrence of a following AS, which "lasts for about 3" USs
- F0 was lower at the end of a longer utterance, just as it was higher at the start

### Consonant Voicing Effects on F0
- F0 typically rose after a voiced consonant to a lower peak value, whereas it fell from a higher peak value after an unvoiced consonant
- Higher fundamental frequencies occur after a voiceless consonant and considerably lower fundamental frequencies occur after a voiced consonant
- When the initial consonant was voiced, the F0 peak occurred in the middle of the syllable nucleus, with a rather smooth glide of the fundamental
- If the consonant was voiceless (especially a voiceless fricative), the peak occurred immediately at the onset of voicing, and the fundamental on the syllable nucleus thereafter decreased
- Fo dip of 12 Hz distinguishes /b/ from /m/ (perceptual cue for labial consonant obstruent vs. sonorant)
- Central F0 values in voiced obstruents are about 13% lower than in sonorants
- "After voiced consonants the peak Fo of the vowel was about 15 Hz lower than after unvoiced consonants"
- "Initial Fo values in stressed vowels are about 20% higher when the preceding consonant is unvoiced rather than voiced, and peak Fo values . . . are about 10% higher"
- If voicing is interrupted by voiceless sounds and then resumed, "the fundamental is slightly higher than before voicing was interrupted," about "a semitone higher"

### Intra-word F0 Descent
- After a typical peak in the range of 145-200 Hz, F0 averaged a descent across a word boundary of about 43% of the F0 distance remaining to the BOR
- These descents were about 20-25 Hz
- When an unvoiced consonant occurred between syllabic nuclei (e.g., "simply"), F0 typically dropped 56%
- When the transition was all voiced (as in "even"), F0 only dropped 28% of the way to the BOR

### Speaker Variation
- Different speakers had different falling rates for F0 in USs
- Speaker JA: typical falling rate of ~150 Hz/sec after F0 peaks
- Speaker KS: more rapid ~400 Hz/sec fall (reaching BOR more rapidly)
- F0 ranges for one-clause utterances (highest and lowest values):
  - JA: 80-190 Hz
  - KS: 65-170 Hz
  - ML: 70-145 Hz
  - DO: 55-135 Hz
  - DK: 70-140 Hz
- F0 peaks in two-clause utterances ranged 30 Hz higher for JA and DO, but no higher for KS

### Three F0 Peak Timing Patterns (Synchronization)
- a) F0 rises to the peak of the SC at the very end of the nucleus of the AS, and F0 in the next nucleus (unaccented) starts falling from a level lower than the peak
- b) F0 rises to the SC peak and then falls, both during the accented vowel, with a continued fall in the next US
- c) F0 rises during the AS, but continues upward to a peak during the next nucleus (unaccented), and then F0 falls - F0 overshoots the end of the AS before it falls

### Dialectal Differences
- American English almost always has a level or rising onset of F0, while British intonation has a "tendency to start at a high pitch"
- American English tends to use the final rise in fewer situations than British English
- The 'polite' use of rising intonation with interrogative word questions is very rare in American English but quite common in British
- The rise-fall-rise contour, usually suggestive of strong implication in British speech, is "uncommon in the English of Americans"
- F0 fall-off slope for General American is "very small" but "rather large for Southern British English"

## Rules/Algorithms

### Anticipation Model for Initial F0 Peak
1. Start with base peak of 152 Hz for a 2-phrase utterance (NP + V)
2. For each additional 'phrase' beyond 2 (up to 5 total), add +12 Hz
3. The addition of 1-2 accented words to initial NP counts as one 'phrase'
4. 3-4 accented words in initial NP counts as 2 'phrases'
5. If initial word starts with unvoiced consonant, add +19 Hz boost
6. Peak saturates at about 188 Hz (for JA)
7. Each non-initial clause counts as one 'phrase'
8. In multi-clause utterances, effects of extra clauses are reduced compared to initial clause phrases

### F0 Descent Calculation Within Words
1. Calculate remaining F0 distance to BOR: `distance = current_F0 - BOR`
2. If transition contains unvoiced consonant: `drop = 0.56 * distance`
3. If transition is all voiced: `drop = 0.28 * distance`
4. Across word boundary (average): `drop = 0.43 * distance`
5. Absolute descent typically 20-25 Hz across word boundaries

### Consonant Voicing F0 Adjustment
1. After unvoiced consonant onset:
   - Initial F0 is 20% higher than after voiced consonant
   - Peak F0 is 10% higher than after voiced consonant
   - F0 tends to fall from a high starting point
2. After voiced consonant onset:
   - Peak F0 is about 15 Hz lower than after unvoiced
   - F0 rises smoothly through the syllable nucleus to peak in middle
   - Peak typically occurs in middle of syllable nucleus
3. After voicing interruption and resumption:
   - F0 rises about 1 semitone higher than before interruption

### Sub-Contour (SC) Generation
1. Start at medium-low F0 level
2. Rise rapidly during the AS to reach peak
3. Fall in exponential decay pattern:
   - Rapid fall initially
   - Slower fall as approaching BOR
   - 'Bottom out' at BOR level
4. Peak timing variations:
   - Pattern (a): Peak at end of AS nucleus, next US starts lower
   - Pattern (b): Peak and fall both within AS, continued fall in next US
   - Pattern (c): Peak in next US after AS (overshoot)

### Separation/Proximity Rules
1. If 2+ USs occur both before AND after an AS: AS is 'well-separated' and gets full accent
2. If 0-1 US intervenes between two ASs: ASs 'trade' accent (both reduced)
3. Back-to-back accents: most of rise occurs in nucleus, little prior jump
4. Back-to-back ASs: create 'double rises' where F0 rises continuously on two consecutive syllables
5. After an AS, its inhibitive effect on following accents lasts for about 3 USs

### Competition Effect
1. More ASs in a sentence = less accent per AS
2. Longer utterances have smaller but more peaks and valleys
3. F0 is lower at the end of longer utterances proportionally
4. F0 is higher at the start of longer utterances proportionally

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Declination baseline**: Implement exponential decay starting at 3%/100ms, decaying to 0.5%/100ms over 5 seconds. Reset at clause boundaries to higher level.

2. **Initial peak anticipation**:
   - Count 'phrases' in utterance (NP, VP, PP, clauses)
   - Base = 152 Hz + (num_phrases - 2) * 12 Hz
   - Cap at ~188 Hz
   - Add +19 Hz for initial unvoiced consonant

3. **Sub-contour shape**: Use exponential decay for the fall after F0 peak. The time constant appears speaker-dependent (JA: ~150 Hz/sec, KS: ~400 Hz/sec).

4. **Voicing effects on F0**:
   - After unvoiced onset: start 20% higher, peak 10% higher, falling contour
   - After voiced onset: start lower, peak 15 Hz lower, rising then falling contour
   - Position peak in middle of nucleus for voiced, at onset for voiceless

5. **Intra-word F0 interpolation**:
   - If unvoiced consonant between vowels: drop 56% of distance to BOR
   - If all voiced: drop only 28% of distance to BOR
   - Across word boundary: drop ~43%

6. **Proximity/separation**:
   - Well-separated ASs (2+ USs on both sides) get full accent
   - Adjacent ASs split the accent (both reduced)
   - Inhibition effect of AS lasts ~3 USs

7. **Competition**: Scale accent magnitudes inversely with total number of ASs in utterance.

8. **Peak timing**: Default to pattern (a) where peak occurs at end of AS nucleus. Pattern (b) for emphasis, pattern (c) is speaker-dependent.

9. **BOR**: Set floor at speaker's BOR (~93 Hz for male). F0 should not go below BOR except at utterance-final position where it can drop 10-15 Hz below.
