# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

A flexible formant synthesizer is required to develop commercial applications and conduct research with synthetic speech. Current implementations of formant synthesizers have limited parameter sets, inflexible synthesis algorithms and rigid architectures. Our implementation of the formant synthesizer is an outgrowth of Klatt's cascade/parallel formant synthesizer.

Additional parameters were incorporated to control the synthesis algorithms, configure the synthesizer architecture and specify acoustic parameters. Several glottal source and noise source models were provided for source excitation. Both the cascade and parallel filter banks were configured by simple parameter specifications. Simple algorithms were used to 1) specify a variable number of filters in both the filter banks at the start-up and during the synthesis, 2) simulate the cascade filter bank by the parallel filter bank, 3) create "zeros" in the magnitude frequency response of the parallel filter bank, 4) detect and remove "clicks" and "pops" which commonly occur in synthetic speech, 5) perform time and frequency scaling of an utterance and 6) simulate source-tract interaction phenomenon. The new/modified features of the flexible formant synthesizer were illustrated with examples of synthesis of sustained vowels and sentences.

The flexible formant synthesizer was utilized for modeling/synthesizing various voice types. The advantage of this approach is that the acoustic characteristics significant for modeling/synthesizing various voice types can be properly controlled. This study focused on modeling/synthesis of creaky, breathy, modal, rough and hoarse voice types. A new glottal source model was developed and incorporated in the flexible formant synthesizer. This model has 1) a voicing source, 2) an aspiration noise source, 3) a pitch perturbation source and 4) an amplitude perturbation source. The time domain glottal factors, such as pitch-period, glottal pulse width, glottal pulse skewness, abruptness of closure of the glottal pulse, aspiration noise, jitter and shimmer, and the frequency domain glottal factors, such as spectral tilt, Harmonic Richness Factor and Harmonic to Noise Ratio were controlled by the glottal source model's parameters. Relationships between glottal factors and the glottal source model's parameters were illustrated with graphs and analytical expressions.

Speech tokens (sustained vowels and sentences) were synthesized, and the quality of these speech tokens were evaluated by informal listening tests. The preliminary results indicate that the glottal source model and the flexible formant synthesizer have the potential for improving the quality of synthetic speech with various voice types.

## Our Interpretation

This dissertation addresses the "buzzy" and "metallic" quality problems in existing Klatt-style formant synthesizers by creating a more flexible architecture with 62 control parameters, multiple glottal source models, and improved algorithms for cascade-parallel matching. The key innovation is a new glottal source model that independently controls time-domain factors (pitch, pulse width, skewness, closure abruptness, jitter, shimmer) and frequency-domain factors (spectral tilt, HRF, HNR) to synthesize different voice qualities including modal, breathy, creaky, rough, and hoarse voices. This work is valuable for speech synthesis because it provides detailed parameter specifications and algorithms that extend Klatt's original synthesizer to produce more natural-sounding speech with controllable voice quality variations.
