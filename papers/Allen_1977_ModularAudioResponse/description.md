This paper presents the modular architecture of MIT's text-to-speech system, defining a pipeline of eight interconnected modules (FORMAT, DECOMP, PARSER, SOUND1, SOUND2, PROSE, SYNTHS, SPEAK) that process text through morphological analysis, parsing, phonological rules, prosody computation, and synthesis-by-rule. The key contribution is establishing a flexible, exportable framework where each linguistic domain has well-defined data structures and can be developed independently, along with special-purpose hardware designs for real-time vocal tract modeling using 32 digital resonators. This 1977 paper documents the precursor to MITalk and establishes the canonical TTS pipeline architecture that influenced all subsequent formant synthesis systems including the Klatt synthesizer.
