# Pages 280-319 Notes

## Chapters/Sections Covered

This chunk is entirely from **Appendix 2: F0 Contour Examples** (continued from earlier pages) and the beginning of **Appendix 3: Scatter Plots**.

- Pages 280-314: F0 contour examples numbered 2.11 through 2.51
- Pages 315-316: F0 contour examples numbered 3.1 through 3.4
- Pages 317-319: Scatter plots numbered 3.5 through 3.8 (beginning of Appendix 3)

## Key Concepts

### Appendix 2: F0 Contour Examples (Continued)

This section provides extensive real F0 contour data from multiple speakers:
- **JBP** (Janet B. Pierrehumbert) - the author
- **MB** (Mary Beckman)
- **MYL** (Mark Y. Liberman) - from Liberman 1975
- **JA** (from O'Shaughnessy 1976)
- **KXG** (another speaker)

Each example shows:
1. Hand-drawn F0 contour with time on x-axis and frequency (Hz) on y-axis
2. The text/sentence spoken
3. Tonal transcription using the Pierrehumbert notation

### Appendix 3: Scatter Plots

Beginning on page 317, this section shows statistical scatter plots of F0 values, demonstrating the relationship between different tonal targets:
- **Figure 3.5**: L% in A vs H* in A (AB order) - Subject JBP
- **Figure 3.6**: H* in A vs L% in A (BA order) - Subject JBP
- **Figure 3.7**: H* in B vs L- in B (AB order) - Subject JBP
- **Figure 3.8**: L- in B vs H* in B (BA order) - Subject JBP

## Tonal Inventory

The examples in this chunk demonstrate the full tonal inventory in context:

### Pitch Accents Observed
| Accent | Example Sentences |
|--------|-------------------|
| H* | Most common; "Try occasional moderate agitation" (p.281), "Which book do you mean" (p.284) |
| L* | "He took advantage of Amanda" (p.283), "It was an unusually dark night" (p.292) |
| L*+H | "Rigamarole is monomorphemic" (p.290) |
| L*+H- | "The cardamon bread was good" (p.291), "Legumes are a good source" (p.287) |
| H*+L- | "Oh Abernathy" (p.305), "Cover your ears" (p.305) |
| H*+H- | "I really believe Ebenezer" (p.285-286) |

### Phrase Accents Observed
| Accent | Context |
|--------|---------|
| H- | Very common intermediate phrase boundary; rises to phrase accent level |
| L- | Common; falls to phrase accent level |

### Boundary Tones Observed
| Tone | Context |
|------|---------|
| H% | Yes-no questions, continuation rises |
| L% | Declarative statements, wh-questions |

## Phonological Rules

No new phonological rules are introduced in this appendix section. However, the examples demonstrate:

1. **Downstep sequences**: Multiple H* accents show progressive lowering (e.g., p.281 "Try occasional moderate agitation" - each H* is lower than the previous)

2. **Phrase-final lowering**: L- phrase accents followed by L% boundary tones show significant F0 drop at phrase boundaries

3. **Interpolation between targets**: The smooth curves between tonal targets demonstrate the linear interpolation discussed in earlier chapters

## Phonetic Implementation

### F0 Ranges Observed (in Hz)

| Speaker | Typical H* Range | Typical L* Range | Notes |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| JBP (female) | 250-350 Hz | 150-200 Hz | Wide pitch range |
| MB (female) | 250-350 Hz | 150-200 Hz | Similar to JBP |
| MYL (male) | 100-150 Hz | 70-100 Hz | Lower male range |

### Key Observations

1. **Y-axis scales**: Most female speaker plots use 100-350 Hz range; male speakers use 60-200 Hz range

2. **Timing markers**: Many examples include duration markers (e.g., "0.4", "0.8" seconds) showing timing of accents relative to text

3. **Segmental effects**: Circled letters on contours indicate specific segments (like /k/, /g/, /b/, /d/) showing microprosodic perturbations

### Scatter Plot Data (Appendix 3)

The scatter plots on pages 317-319 show:

**Figure 3.5** (p.317): L% vs H* in AB order
- L% values cluster around 150-200 Hz
- H* values spread from ~150-550 Hz
- Shows weak positive correlation

**Figure 3.6** (p.318): H* vs L% in BA order
- Strong positive linear correlation
- H* range: ~250-650 Hz
- L% range: ~150-250 Hz
- Demonstrates that higher H* correlates with higher L%

**Figure 3.7** (p.319): H* vs L- in AB order
- Strong positive linear correlation
- Data clusters tightly along diagonal
- H* range: ~200-500 Hz
- L- range: ~150-350 Hz

**Figure 3.8** (p.319): L- vs H* in BA order
- Similar pattern to 3.5
- L- values cluster in narrow range (~150-300 Hz)
- H* values spread wider (~300-600 Hz)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "2.36C) impossible in English" (page 301)
> [Shows schematic F0 contour labeled as impossible - a contour with L* rising to H- then staying flat to L%]

> "2.36D) also impossible" (page 301)
> [Shows another impossible contour - L* rising to H- then falling directly to L%]

These "impossible" contours on page 301 are critical - they show what patterns CANNOT occur in English intonation according to Pierrehumbert's phonological constraints.

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Typical F0 ranges by gender**:
   - Female: baseline ~200 Hz, peaks to ~350 Hz, troughs to ~150 Hz
   - Male: baseline ~100 Hz, peaks to ~150 Hz, troughs to ~70 Hz

2. **Downstep implementation**: The examples clearly show that successive H* accents in a phrase are progressively lower. Each H* should be approximately 10-20 Hz lower than the previous one.

3. **Impossible contours to avoid** (from p.301):
   - Do NOT generate flat plateaus after a phrase accent
   - Do NOT have phrase accents without subsequent movement to boundary tone

4. **Correlation data from scatter plots**:
   - When implementing F0 scaling, note that H* and L% values are correlated
   - Higher pitch range speakers use higher L% values proportionally
   - The H* to L- relationship is approximately linear

5. **Question intonation patterns**:
   - Yes-no questions: L* H- H% (low accent, rising to high boundary)
   - Wh-questions: H* L- L% (high accent on wh-word, falling to low boundary)
   - The examples on p.300 ("The Uruguayan bulldozer drivers' union?") show this clearly

6. **Bitonal accent timing**:
   - L*+H- and H*+L- show timing where the starred tone aligns with stressed syllable
   - The trailing tone occurs on the following syllable
   - Duration between tones is typically 100-200ms based on the contour examples

7. **Czech vs English** (p.302-303): The Karel examples show that other languages may have different patterns - but for English TTS, stick to the patterns shown in the English examples.
