## Key Findings

### Turbulence Noise Sources for /h/
- For /h/, turbulence noise is generated at TWO locations:
  1. Near the glottis (aspiration noise)
  2. Near the supraglottal constriction (frication noise)
- Front-cavity resonance for /i/ configuration: ~3000 Hz with bandwidth ~300 Hz
- The transfer function from noise source to mouth has a zero close to zero frequency and a pole at the front-cavity natural frequency

### Noise Source Amplitude Relationships
- Noise source amplitude is roughly proportional to U^3 * A^(-2.5) where U = airflow, A = cross-sectional area
- For modal glottal vibration, mean value of U^3*A^(-2.5) is 196 dB for 8 cm H2O subglottal pressure
- For breathy voicing (mid-/h/), the value is 206 dB - about 10 dB below modal glottal vibration

### Periodic vs Noise Components
- During modal voicing: periodic component dominates below ~3 kHz
- During breathy voicing: noise component exceeds periodic at higher frequencies
- At vowel edges during /h/: noise increases and periodic amplitude decreases, becoming comparable
- Maximum turbulence noise occurs when glottal opening is widest (just before maximum negative rate of change of volume velocity)

### Voiceless Aspirated Stop Consonants (/p^h/, /t^h/, /k^h/)
- Initial time interval: turbulence noise generated near glottis (supraglottal constriction)
- Followed by breathy voicing interval
- Finally modal voicing
- Glottal area vs time follows similar pattern to /h/ (figure 8.58)

### Timing Parameters for Voiceless Aspirated Stops
- Onset of vocal fold vibration: 50-60 ms after release
- Peak airflow for labial: ~1000 cm^3/s
- Peak airflow for velar: somewhat lower, occurs later
- Critical glottal area for vibration onset: ~0.12 cm^2
- This critical point reached ~50 ms after release for labials

### Noise Source Sequence at Stop Release
Three types of sources occur in sequence:
1. **Transient** - generated at instant of release (rapid airflow increase)
2. **Frication** - noise at/near consonantal constriction
3. **Aspiration** - noise generated near glottis before voicing onset

### Place-Dependent Characteristics
- **Labial release**: spectrum slopes downward, high-frequency amplitude weaker than following vowel in F4/F5 range
- **Alveolar release**: spectrum amplitude in F4/F5 range greater than following vowel due to transient/frication from short front cavity
- **Velar release**: midfrequency spectrum peak comparable to F2/F3 prominence in following vowel

### Aspiration Noise Characteristics
- For labial: supraglottal constriction noise dominant for initial 6 ms, then glottis noise dominant
- After ~10 ms from release: aspiration noise source remains constant until vocal fold vibration onset (~50 ms)
- For velar: source at supraglottal constriction larger than glottal noise source for initial 25 ms
- Frication noise source is ~5 dB greater for aspirated than unaspirated stops (longer duration: 6 ms vs 3 ms)

### Spectral Peaks for Aspiration
- Aspiration noise relative to vowel for F2, F3, F4, F5: -13, -12, -9, and 0 dB respectively
- Differences from theoretical predictions: within a few dB
- Low-frequency peak at ~800 Hz indicates acoustic coupling to subglottal system

### F0 Changes Near Stop Release
- Fundamental frequency increases 5-10% at beginning of vowel following voiceless aspirated stop
- F0 falls about 18 Hz in the 20-30 ms after onset of glottal vibration
- This raised F0 reflects increased vocal fold stiffness during closure interval

## Equations Found

### Noise Source Amplitude (Equation 8.2)
$$U^3 A^{-2.5} = \left(\frac{2}{\rho}\right)^{3/2} \Delta P^{3/2} A^{1/2}$$

Where:
- $U$ = volume velocity (airflow)
- $A$ = cross-sectional area of constriction
- $\Delta P$ = pressure drop = $\rho U^2 / (2A^2)$
- $\rho$ = density of air

### Resistance Equations
$$R_g = \rho U_g / (2A_g^2)$$
$$R_c = \rho U_c / (2A_c^2)$$

Where:
- $R_g$ = glottal resistance
- $R_c$ = supraglottal constriction resistance
- $A_g$ = glottal area
- $A_c$ = constriction area

### Glottal Pulse Amplitude
- Amplitude proportional to $\Delta P^{1.5}$ where $\Delta P$ is transglottal pressure
- For voiced stop: ratio of transglottal pressure during closure to that in vowel is 0.5 to 0.7
- This implies H1 amplitude 5-9 dB below vowel value: $20 \log 0.5^{1.5} = -9$ dB and $20 \log 0.7^{1.5} = -5$ dB

## Formant Data

### F1 and F2 During Voiced Stop Closure
- F1 decreases to ~200 Hz at implosion
- F2 for labial: shows expected pattern
- F2 for alveolar: higher after /t/ than after /p/
- At the burst: alveolar has high-frequency amplitude (around 4 kHz) in excess of following vowel

### F0 Patterns
- F0 for vowel adjacent to voiced stop: 10-15% lower than adjacent to voiceless stop
- This difference arises from:
  1. Slackened vocal folds for voiced stop (5-7% F0 reduction)
  2. Increased F0 for voiceless stop (5-10% due to increased stiffness)

### H1-H2 Difference
- During breathy voicing onset: H1-H2 rises (indicating breathy voice quality)
- At modal voicing: H1-H2 levels stabilize
- For voiced fricatives: H1-H2 difference indicates continuing adduction

## Rules/Algorithms

### Voicing Maintenance for Stops
1. **Transglottal pressure** must remain sufficient for vocal fold vibration
2. **Vocal tract volume** must expand to accommodate airflow during closure
3. Methods of volume expansion:
   - Lowering larynx (4-6 mm for voiced stops)
   - Forward tongue root displacement (3-5 mm)
   - Passive wall displacement (cheeks, pharynx)
4. If transglottal pressure drops below ~3 cm H2O, vibration ceases

### Sequence of Events for /hV/ Syllable
1. Glottis abducted, turbulence noise generated near glottis
2. Possible noise near supraglottal constriction (for high vowels)
3. Vocal folds gradually adduct
4. Initial breathy voicing (few tens of ms)
5. Transition to modal voicing

### Voiceless Aspirated Stop Release Sequence
1. t = 0: Consonant release (transient burst)
2. t = 0-4 ms: Transient dominates
3. t = 4-10 ms: Frication noise dominates
4. t = 10-50 ms: Aspiration noise dominates
5. t = 50+ ms: Voicing onset (breathy then modal)

### Voiced Stop Production Requirements
1. Expand vocal tract volume during closure (~15 cm^3 total)
2. Maintain transglottal pressure above threshold
3. Lower larynx and advance tongue root
4. Glottal pulses decrease in amplitude during closure (proportional to pressure drop)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

"The amplitude of the noise source is roughly proportional to U^3*A^(-2.5), as we have seen. Since the pressure drop Delta P across the glottis is approximately constant (equal to the subglottal pressure), it is convenient to write the expression for the amplitude of the sound pressure source as..." (p. 446)

"The interplay of the periodic and noise components of the source is schematized in figure 8.56. This figure shows the estimated mid-frequency amplitudes (in the third-formant range) of these two source components as a function of time for /h/ in intervocalic position." (p. 448)

"These three types of sources that occur in sequence - transient, frication, and aspiration - form the excitation of the time-varying vocal tract, as has been schematized in figure 7.17 for a voiceless unaspirated stop consonant." (p. 459)

"For the voiced stop, the stiffness decreases during the closure, possibly as a consequence of the downward displacement of the larynx, as noted above. This vocal fold slackening carries over into the following vowel, causing a decreased fundamental frequency of vocal fold vibration during the initial 50 to 100 ms of the vowel." (p. 470)

"In the case of the voiceless stop consonant, an increase in stiffness is postulated, as discussed in section 8.3.2 in the analysis of the voiceless aspirated stop. This increased stiffness accounts for the increased fundamental frequency observed at the beginning of a vowel following a voiceless obstruent consonant." (p. 470-471)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Aspiration Noise Timing**: After stop release, aspiration noise should dominate from ~10-50 ms, with amplitude following U^3*A^(-2.5) relationship.

2. **Source Amplitude Scaling**:
   - Aspiration relative to vowel: F2 -13 dB, F3 -12 dB, F4 -9 dB, F5 0 dB
   - These values can guide AH (aspiration amplitude) parameter settings

3. **VOT Implementation**:
   - Labial: ~50-60 ms
   - Alveolar: similar
   - Velar: slightly later due to slower pressure equalization

4. **F0 Perturbation**:
   - After voiceless stops: F0 should be 5-10% higher initially, then fall ~18 Hz over 20-30 ms
   - After voiced stops: F0 should be 5-7% lower than baseline

5. **Voiced Stop Voicing Bar**:
   - Amplitude decreases during closure (5-9 dB below vowel)
   - F0 may decrease slightly during closure due to falling transglottal pressure

6. **Burst Spectrum by Place**:
   - Labial: flat or falling spectrum
   - Alveolar: emphasis at high frequencies (F4/F5 range), +5 dB relative to vowel
   - Velar: midfrequency peak at F2/F3

7. **Breathy Voicing Transition**:
   - First few periods after voicing onset should be breathy
   - H1-H2 elevated (more positive) during breathy interval
   - Transition to modal over ~30-40 ms

8. **Noise Source Location**:
   - For high vowels (/i/, /u/): supraglottal frication noise may contribute significantly
   - At F3 frequency for /hi/: palatal noise source dominates aspiration
   - For /hu/: velar noise dominates, exciting F2 resonance

9. **Glottal Area Trajectory**:
   - Opens during closure (abduction for voiceless)
   - Peaks around release time
   - Returns to ~0.12 cm^2 at voicing onset
   - Time constant differs by place: velar slower than labial
