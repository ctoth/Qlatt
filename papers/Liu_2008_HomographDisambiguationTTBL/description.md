This paper presents TTBL, a hybrid algorithm that combines decision trees with transformation-based learning to automatically generate disambiguation templates for Mandarin polyphones in TTS systems. The key innovation is using error-driven template generation—combining templates learned from both all training data and error-only data—which improves accuracy from 80.66% to 90.36% on 33 key Mandarin characters. The method is relevant to speech synthesis because it provides an interpretable, rule-based approach to heteronym/polyphone disambiguation that can incorporate existing manual rules and avoids the manual labor of hand-crafted template creation.
