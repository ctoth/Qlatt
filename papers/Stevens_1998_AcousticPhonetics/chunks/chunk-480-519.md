## Key Findings

### Voiced Obstruent Consonants (pp. 480-483)
- F0 parameter starts high following voiceless consonant, suggesting vocal fold stiffening during voiceless interval
- Voiced obstruents: speaker facilitates vocal fold vibration by decreasing vocal tract wall stiffness and allowing volume expansion
- Voiceless obstruents: speaker inhibits vibration by increasing vocal fold/wall stiffness and preventing volume expansion
- The frequency of glottal vibration in the first few tens of milliseconds after obstruent reflects voicing status

### Nasal Consonants - General (pp. 483-490)
- Nasals produced like stops but with velopharyngeal port open during closure
- No pressure increase behind constriction during nasal murmur
- Velopharyngeal opening area: approximately 0.2 cm^2
- Total time for lowering-raising soft palate movement: 200-250 ms
- Time velopharyngeal port actually open: about 200 ms
- During nasal murmur with oral closure, vocal folds continue to vibrate normally (nasal murmur)

### Low-Frequency Output for Nasals (pp. 485-489)
- Sound radiated from nose during nasal murmur
- Lowest pole of transfer function (glottis to nose): 250-300 Hz for adults
- This is a Helmholtz resonance between acoustic compliance of vocal tract and acoustic mass of nasal passages
- Bandwidth of lowest resonance: about 100 Hz (somewhat greater than F1 bandwidth for high vowels)
- Zero-frequency value of transfer function: 1.5-4.0 dB above 0 dB
- Second pole during nasal murmur: 750-1000 Hz (neglecting sinus effects)
- F1 region: 300-900 Hz depending on speaker/vowel configuration

### High-Frequency Output for Nasals (pp. 490-507)
- At implosion/release: rapid change in radiated sound spectrum due to:
  1. Rapid configuration change leading to shifts in natural frequencies
  2. Output switch from nose to mouth (or combined)
- First formant frequency characterized by two poles and a zero (pole-zero-pole triplet)
- Pole-zero pairs due to sinus coupling

#### Labial Nasals /m/ (pp. 490-497)
- Closure at lips: mouth cavity length = half total vocal tract length
- Lowest zero at about 1000-1200 Hz for adults
- Average pole spacing: 650-750 Hz (total oral + nasal tract length 25-28 cm)
- At release: mouth opening grows, zeros shift to new positions for nasalized vowel
- F2 prominence increase over 30-ms transition: about 26 dB (around 1000 Hz)
- Spectral peak at 200 Hz dominates murmur, second peak at 750 Hz for /m/
- Abrupt increase of about 17 dB in A2 amplitude at release
- F2 spectral peak frequency rises 200 Hz over 15-ms time interval (frames 7-10)

#### Alveolar Nasals /n/ (pp. 495-504)
- Closure formed with tongue blade
- Mouth cavity length: 5-6 cm (velopharyngeal port to closure)
- Lowest zero: 1600-1900 Hz range for adults
- Second zero expected at about three times this frequency
- Within 10 ms following release: rapid change in spectrum amplitude
- F2 spectral peak at about 1500 Hz shows abrupt increase of 17 dB at release
- Frequency of F2 peak rises 200 Hz over 15-ms interval as front-vowel configuration reached
- Zero in nasal murmur at about 1900 Hz

#### Velar Nasals (pp. 503-511)
- During murmur: cavity between velopharyngeal opening and oral closure very short
- No zero in transfer function (all-pole transfer function during murmur)
- Contains only poles at 250, 1200, 2100, 3200 Hz
- At release: resonance at 1800 Hz appears as prominent peak (no longer obscured by zero)
- Crossover time (mouth output > nasal output): 10-15 ms
- Zero Zf accounts for acoustic coupling to front cavity (at about 2000 Hz during murmur)
- At release: Zf merges with pole, leaving F5 to manifest as spectral peak

### Summary of Nasal Consonant Acoustics (pp. 512-513)
- Murmur spectrum: low-frequency prominence at about 250 Hz, weaker prominence around 1000 Hz
- 1000 Hz resonance associated with nasal cavity (velopharyngeal port at posterior end)
- Spectral peaks during murmur depend on whether closure is at lips, tongue blade, or tongue body
- Principal attribute at release: 15-20 dB increase in spectrum amplitude in F2/F3 region
- Transitions of F2 and F3 following release depend on articulator and are similar to stops

### Glides (pp. 513-523)
- Constriction narrow enough to cause significant average pressure drop
- No turbulence noise generated
- Vocal folds vibrate during constricted interval (like nasals)
- Difference from nasals: air flows past constriction in vocal tract (not through nasal cavity)

#### Low-Frequency Characteristics of Glides (pp. 513-520)
- Minimum cross-sectional area achievable without significant pressure drop: 0.17 cm^2
- For a glide, Ac should be about 1.7 times Ag (glottal area)
- F1 for constricted configurations (equation 9.2):
  - F1c = 180 Hz (constant for adult, walls assumed hard)
  - F1' = c / (2*pi*sqrt(V*l_c/A_c)) where c = velocity of sound
- For palatal configuration: volume behind constriction about 50 cm^3, constriction length 3.0 cm, area 0.17 cm^2
- Helmholtz resonance for palatal glide configuration: about 190 Hz
- With wall correction: F1 for palatal glide about 270 Hz (same as labial)
- Minimum F1 expected for glide: about 260 Hz

- F1 at minimum point in glide about 40 Hz lower when preceding high vowel
- Glide articulation more narrowly constricted before high vowels (to enhance contrast)

#### High-Frequency Characteristics of Glides (pp. 519-523)
- F1 bandwidth for glide: 100-150 Hz (greater than bandwidth for most vowels)
- Calculated F1 bandwidth for labiovelar glide: 60 Hz (similar bandwidth expected for palatal)
- Glottal pulse modification during constriction: pressure drop causes reduced glottal pulse amplitude
- First harmonic amplitude decreases by 2-3 dB; first-formant prominence reduces by 5-10 dB

##### Labial Glide /w/ (pp. 519-523)
- Decrease in F2 and higher-formant frequencies, plus lowering of F1
- Tongue body raised in velar region produces secondary constriction in middle of vocal tract
- Volume behind constriction: about 50 cm^3; constriction length: 3.0 cm; area: 0.17 cm^2
- Second natural frequency for labial glide circuit: about 700 Hz
- F2 bandwidth contribution from kinetic resistances at constrictions: about 150 Hz
- Rate of cross-sectional area change at implosion/release: about 10 cm^2/s
- Compare to labial/alveolar stops (100 cm^2/s) and velar stops (25 cm^2/s)

## Rules/Algorithms

### Nasal Consonant Synthesis Rules

1. **Murmur Production**:
   - Maintain low-frequency prominence at 250 Hz
   - Include weaker prominence at 750-1000 Hz
   - Add zeros dependent on place of articulation:
     - Labial: Z1 ~ 1000-1200 Hz
     - Alveolar: Z1 ~ 1600-1900 Hz
     - Velar: No zeros (all-pole)

2. **Nasal Release Transition**:
   - Duration: 10-20 ms for abrupt spectrum change
   - F2 amplitude increase: 15-20 dB
   - F2 frequency rise: ~200 Hz over 15-ms interval
   - Zero shifts rapidly as velopharyngeal port closes

3. **Voiced Obstruent Voicing Rule**:
   - F0 rises following voiceless consonant (vocal fold stiffening)
   - F0 shows different pattern following voiced consonant
   - First few tens of milliseconds of vowel reflect consonant voicing

### Glide Synthesis Rules

1. **Constriction Timing**:
   - Total duration: 200-250 ms
   - Rate of area change: ~10 cm^2/s (slower than stops)
   - Crossover from minimum to vowel target: 50-100 ms

2. **F1 Trajectory**:
   - Minimum F1: ~260 Hz (both /w/ and /j/)
   - F1 transitions approximate parabolic contour
   - Before high vowels: F1 40 Hz lower at minimum

3. **Amplitude Relationships**:
   - A1 reduction at glide: 5-12 dB depending on vowel context
   - First harmonic amplitude reduces 2-3 dB during constriction
   - Greater reduction before high vowels (enhances contrast)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "During the closure or constricted interval for an obstruent consonant, there is a pressure buildup behind the constriction, and consequently a reduced pressure drop across the glottis." (p. 480)

> "To produce a voiced obstruent, the speaker can facilitate vocal fold vibration during the consonantal interval by decreasing the stiffness of the vocal tract walls and of the vocal folds." (p. 480)

> "Like the stop consonants described in chapter 7, nasal consonants are produced by forming a complete closure at some point along the length of the oral region of the vocal tract... The principal difference, however, is that for a nasal consonant the velopharyngeal port is open during the time there is a supraglottal closure, and there is no pressure increase behind the constriction."

## Implementation Notes

### For Nasal Consonant Synthesis

1. **Transfer Function Structure**:
   - Nasals require pole-zero pairs, not just poles
   - Zero frequencies depend on place of articulation
   - Labial: extra zero around 1000-1200 Hz
   - Alveolar: extra zero around 1600-1900 Hz
   - Velar: all-pole during murmur (no extra zeros)

2. **Transition Timing**:
   - Nasal murmur to vowel transition: 10-20 ms for major spectral changes
   - F2 amplitude jump of 15-20 dB should occur within this window
   - Zero shifts rapidly as mouth opening increases

3. **Low-Frequency Prominence**:
   - Nasal murmur characterized by strong low-frequency peak at 250 Hz
   - This is the "murmur bar" visible in spectrograms
   - Second weaker peak around 750-1000 Hz

4. **Bandwidth Considerations**:
   - Nasal pole bandwidth: ~100 Hz (broader than vowel F1)
   - Additional losses due to nasal passage walls/sinuses

### For Glide Synthesis

1. **Timing Parameters**:
   - Total glide duration: 200-250 ms
   - Slower transitions than stops (10 cm^2/s vs 100 cm^2/s)
   - F1 trajectory approximately parabolic

2. **F1 Control**:
   - Minimum F1 around 260 Hz for both /w/ and /j/
   - F1 should be ~40 Hz lower before high vowels
   - Bandwidth increases to 100-150 Hz during constriction

3. **Amplitude Effects**:
   - Reduce A1 (first formant amplitude) by 5-12 dB at glide
   - Greater reduction when followed by high vowel
   - Reduction in first harmonic amplitude: 2-3 dB

4. **Formant Patterns**:
   - /w/: F1 low (~260 Hz), F2 low (~700 Hz), both rise to following vowel
   - /j/: F1 low (~260 Hz), F2 high (near /i/), F1 rises, F2 falls or stays high

### Key Synthesis Considerations

1. **Voiced Obstruent F0 Pattern**:
   - F0 should start higher after voiceless consonants (vocal fold stiffening)
   - Different F0 onset pattern distinguishes voiced from voiceless

2. **Nasal vs Stop Transitions**:
   - Nasal transitions similar to stops but with murmur preceding
   - Both show rapid F2/F3 changes at release
   - Nasals have characteristic low-frequency murmur bar

3. **Glide vs Vowel Distinction**:
   - Glides reach lower F1 minimum than vowels
   - Longer transition times than consonants
   - Reduced amplitude during constriction
