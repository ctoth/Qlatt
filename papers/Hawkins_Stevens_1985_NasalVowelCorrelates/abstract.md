# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

For each of five vowels [i e a o u] following [t], a continuum from non-nasal to nasal was synthesized. Nasalization was introduced by inserting a pole-zero pair in the vicinity of the first formant in an all-pole transfer function. The frequencies and spacing of the pole and zero were systematically varied to change the degree of nasalization. The selection of stimulus parameters was determined from acoustic theory and the results of pilot experiments. The stimuli were presented for identification and discrimination to listeners whose language included a non-nasal–nasal vowel opposition (Gujarati, Hindi, and Bengali) and to American listeners. There were no significant differences between language groups in the 50% crossover points of the identification functions. Some vowels were more influenced by range and context effects than were others. The language groups showed some differences in the shape of the discrimination functions for some vowels. On the basis of the results, it is postulated that (1) there is a basic acoustic property of nasality, independent of the vowel, to which the auditory system responds in a distinctive way regardless of language background; and (2) there are one or more additional acoustic properties that may be used to various degrees in different languages to enhance the contrast between a nasal vowel and its non-nasal counterpart. A proposed candidate for the basic acoustic property is a measure of the degree of prominence of the spectral peak in the vicinity of the first formant. Additional secondary properties include shifts in the center of gravity of the low-frequency spectral prominence, leading to a change in perceived vowel height, and changes in overall spectral balance.

## Our Interpretation

This paper experimentally identifies the acoustic correlates of nasalization in vowels by synthesizing continua from oral to nasal for five vowels, with the key variable being a pole-zero pair inserted near the first formant. The core finding is that nasality perception relies on a universal acoustic property (prominence of the spectral peak near F1) plus language-specific secondary properties (vowel height shifts, spectral balance). This work is essential for formant synthesis of nasal vowels, providing precise pole-zero spacing parameters and quantifying how nasalization modifies the acoustic spectrum in speech synthesis systems.
