This paper investigates how formant bandwidth affects the identification of vowels when two are presented simultaneously, finding that while bandwidth has little effect on isolated vowel quality, it strongly influences mutual masking between competing vowels. The key finding is that narrow-bandwidth vowels are both more resistant to masking and more powerful maskers than wide-bandwidth vowels, with a 4-fold bandwidth change equivalent to approximately 10 dB amplitude difference or 6% F0 difference. This work is relevant to speech synthesis for understanding how bandwidth parameters affect intelligibility in adverse listening conditions and for modeling vocal effort effects on formant characteristics.
