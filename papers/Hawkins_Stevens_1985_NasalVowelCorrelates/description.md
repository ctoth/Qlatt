This paper identifies the universal acoustic correlates of vowel nasality, determining that a pole-zero pair near the first formant frequency is the key perceptual cue that allows listeners across different language backgrounds to distinguish nasal from oral vowels. The researchers establish that optimal nasal vowel synthesis uses a nasal zero frequency positioned midway between the nasal pole and F1, with a pole-zero spacing of 75-110 Hz at the perceptual identification boundary. These findings provide direct implementation parameters for the Klatt synthesizer to generate perceptually accurate nasal vowels by controlling nasal pole and zero frequencies rather than attempting to model the complex acoustics of actual nasal coupling.
