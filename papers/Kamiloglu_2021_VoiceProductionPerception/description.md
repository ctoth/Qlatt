This paper is a comprehensive review of voice production physiology and perception, covering source-filter theory, acoustic parameters of human vocalization, and the mapping between physiological mechanisms and perceived vocal qualities including emotion and speaker identity. The key contribution is a detailed exposition of how vocal fold vibration and vocal tract filtering work independently to generate speech, combined with systematic mappings between acoustic features (pitch, loudness, spectral characteristics) and perceptual outcomes (emotion arousal/valence, voice quality, speaker characteristics). For speech synthesis, this work is essential because it provides the physiological foundation for understanding which acoustic parameters matter and how they combine—directly informing the design of parameters like voice quality modes, formant control, and prosodic modifications needed to produce natural-sounding synthetic speech.
