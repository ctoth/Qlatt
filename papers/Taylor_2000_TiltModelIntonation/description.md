The Tilt model represents F0 intonation contours using three independent parameters—amplitude, duration, and tilt—to describe pitch accents and boundary tones in a continuous rather than categorical framework. The model achieves automatic event detection via HMMs and provides equations for both analyzing F0 contours from speech and synthesizing new contours, with synthesis accuracy nearly identical to the more complex RFC model despite having fewer parameters. For speech synthesis, Tilt enables systematic generation of natural prosody by mapping accent-bearing syllables to events with predictable acoustic properties, supporting flexible F0 contour generation from prosodic markup.
