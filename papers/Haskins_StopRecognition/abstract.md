# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Three experiments assessed the roles of release bursts and formant transitions as acoustic cues to place of articulation in syllable-initial voiced stop consonants by systematically removing them from American English /b,d,g/ spoken before nine different vowels by two speakers, and by transposing the bursts across all vowels for each class of stop consonant. The results showed that bursts were largely invariant in their effect, but carried significant perceptual weight in only one syllable out of 27 for Speaker 1, in only 18 syllables out of 27 for Speaker 2. Furthermore, bursts and transitions tended to be reciprocally related: Where the perceptual weight of one increased, the weight of the other declined. They were thus shown to be functionally equivalent, context-dependent cues, each contributing to the rapid spectral changes that follow consonantal release. The results are interpreted as pointing to the possible role of the front-cavity resonance in signaling place of articulation.

## Our Interpretation

This study challenges the assumption that release bursts alone are sufficient cues for stop consonant recognition, demonstrating instead that both bursts and formant transitions work together as complementary acoustic cues. The key finding is that these cues show reciprocal weighting depending on vowel context: when one becomes perceptually important, the other becomes less so, suggesting the listener integrates spectral continuity across the release into the following vowel. For speech synthesis, this implies that accurate stop consonant quality depends on modeling the interaction between burst energy and formant transition patterns in context-specific ways, rather than treating bursts and transitions as independent parameters.
