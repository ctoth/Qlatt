This paper provides a comprehensive review of vowel formant frequencies and bandwidths for American English across the lifespan, synthesizing data from 12 major studies conducted between 1952 and 2009. Key findings establish normative ranges for F1-F3 frequencies and bandwidths in adults, children, and elderly speakers, document non-uniform sex-based scaling factors (~1.15-1.20 for females), and identify critical sources of measurement error including F1-f0 proximity in high-pitched speakers and nasalization effects. This work is essential for speech synthesis because it provides the empirical basis for selecting realistic formant targets and bandwidths that account for speaker age, sex, and vocal tract characteristics.
