## Key Concepts

### Boundary Tones (T%)

Boundary tones occur at the phrase boundary, regardless of stress pattern of adjacent material. Two types:
- **H%** - High boundary tone (continuation rise)
- **L%** - Low boundary tone

Key properties:
- Boundary tone occurs right at the phrase boundary (Liberman 1975)
- Can occur at utterance initial position as well as phrase final
- H% initial boundary tone adds "vivacity" - corresponds to "high prehead" in O'Connor and Arnold (1961)
- H% stays at phrase boundary even when first syllables are unstressed (Figure 27)

### Phrase Accent (T-)

The phrase accent occurs after the nuclear pitch accent and before the phrase final boundary tone. Two types:
- **H-** - High phrase accent
- **L-** - Low phrase accent

Key finding: The phrase accent is placed at the boundary of the word carrying the nuclear accent, regardless of stress pattern (page 86).

Implementation rules for phrase accent and boundary tone (pages 89-90):
1. H- in L*+H- spreads from its location at end of word with nuclear stress to end of phrase
2. L- in H* L- H% spreads similarly - maintained until rise to H% occurs
3. H- spreads before H% (which is higher) or L% (which is equal after upstep)
4. L- spreads before H% but NOT before L% (blocked because L% is on baseline and L- is somewhat higher)

### Upstep Rule

Target values for L% and H% after H- are shifted upwards compared to their target values after L-:
- Like downstep, upstep is a rule which readjusts the phonetic value of a tone in a particular context
- The formulation of the rule is discussed in Chapter 4

### Tags

Tags (vocatives, expletives, epithets, tag questions, sentence adverbials) have special intonation:
- Postposed tags characteristically lack F0 marking of prominence - they do not carry pitch accents
- Two grammatical analyses for tags (pages 97-99):
  1. Tag carries a second phrase accent following the first boundary tone
  2. Tag carries both phrase accent AND second boundary tone

Grammar diagram (page 98) shows allowable tonal sequences with all pitch accent types (H*, L*, L*+H-, L-+H*, H*+L-, H-+L*, H*+H-) connecting to phrase accents (H-, L-) and boundary tones (H%, L%).

### Three Components of Phrase-Final F0

The F0 contour from nuclear stress to end of intonation phrase has three contributions (page 91):
1. **Nuclear pitch accent** - The starred tone on the stressed syllable
2. **Phrase accent** - H- or L- between nuclear accent and boundary
3. **Boundary tone** - H% or L% at the phrase edge

This decomposition allows:
- Predicting F0 configurations over post-nuclear material
- Cross-classifying contours (same phrase accent, different boundary tones, etc.)
- Explaining why prenuclear and nuclear pitch accents use the same inventory

### F0 as Perceptual Cue

From experimental literature (Section 2.6):
- F0 is NOT a direct transducer of stress - a word can have different F0 contours depending on intonation pattern
- F0 serves as cue for stress only when the pattern is compatible with only one stress location
- Interpolation between pitch accents is insensitive to word boundaries
- F0 can disambiguate surface structure (bracketing) but not deep structure or homonyms

### Declination Introduction (Chapter 3)

Declination is a gradual downdrift and narrowing of pitch range:
- Occurs within the body of the intonation phrase
- Often spans several intonation phrases
- Does NOT arise from tonal specifications
- Rather, it's a factor in determining how tonal specifications are mapped into F0 values

## Tonal Inventory

### Pitch Accents (from grammar diagram, page 98)
- H* (high)
- L* (low)
- L*+H- (scooped, rising)
- L-+H*
- H*+L- (falling)
- H-+L*
- H*+H-

### Phrase Accents
- H- (high phrase accent)
- L- (low phrase accent)

### Boundary Tones
- H% (high boundary tone - question/continuation rise)
- L% (low boundary tone - statement/finality)

## Phonological Rules

### Spreading Rule for Phrase Accent

The phrase accent (like H- in L*+H-) is subject to spreading:
- In H* L- H%, the L- spreads from its location at end of word with nuclear stress to end of phrase
- Result: the rise to H% occurs only at very end of phrase, not spread over post-nuclear material

### Spreading Context for T-

T- spreads when the next tone is phonetically equal or higher:
- H- spreads before H% (higher) or L% (equal after upstep)
- L- spreads before H% but NOT before L%
- L- L% is implemented as gradual F0 fall rather than F0 plateau

### Upstep Rule

After H- phrase accent:
- Both L% and H% are shifted upwards
- This parallels downstep (after H*, subsequent tones are lowered)

## Phonetic Implementation

### Phrase Accent Alignment

The phrase accent is placed at the end of the word carrying the nuclear accent (page 86):
- "gorbelly" example: H- does not occur until the following unstressed syllable
- This is the "strongest hypothesis" from the corpus study

### Timing Distinctions

L*+H- H- vs L* H- can be distinguished when there is enough syllabic material:
- L*+H- H- has very sharp rise in pitch after accented syllable
- L* H- has rise spanning whole word carrying accented syllable

### Questions vs Statements

Questions have same overall shape as statements, slightly downdrifting (page 91):
- Only the phrase-final sequence H- H% (compressed onto single syllable) generates F0 value standing out above the generally falling pattern

### Disambiguation by F0

Streeter (1978) found speakers used intonational phrase boundary to disambiguate surface structure bracketing:
- One speaker used H* L- H% on last (or only) variable in first phrase
- Other speaker used L* pitch accent with H% boundary tone

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Phrase-final contour**: Decompose into three components:
   - Nuclear pitch accent (on stressed syllable)
   - Phrase accent (at end of word with nuclear stress)
   - Boundary tone (at phrase edge)

2. **Spreading implementation**:
   - H- spreads (maintains level) until H% or L% at phrase end
   - L- spreads before H% but falls gradually before L%

3. **Upstep after H-**:
   - When phrase accent is H-, raise targets for following L% and H%
   - This is parallel to downstep (lowering after H*)

4. **Tag intonation**:
   - Tags typically lack pitch accents
   - Implement as continuation of phrase accent from main clause
   - Or as separate phrase with its own phrase accent + boundary tone

5. **Boundary tone timing**:
   - H% initial: implement at very start of phrase
   - H%/L% final: implement at very end of phrase, after phrase accent spread

6. **Disambiguation patterns**:
   - Use phrase boundaries (with phrase accent + boundary tone) to mark surface structure
   - H* L- L% for statements
   - H* L- H% for yes/no questions or continuation
   - L* H- H% for surprise/incredulity questions

7. **Declination** (from Chapter 3 intro):
   - Apply gradual downdrift across intonation phrase
   - Apply pitch range narrowing
   - This is separate from tonal specifications - it's a mapping factor

8. **Prominence marking**:
   - H* L- L% with H* on focused word = "A" pattern (answer to question)
   - H* L- H% with H* on background info = "B" pattern (given information)
   - The H* in "A" pattern is more prominent than in "B" pattern
