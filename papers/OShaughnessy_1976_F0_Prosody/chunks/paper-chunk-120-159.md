## Key Findings

### Accent Priority List (Major Finding)

A major finding of this thesis involves an **ordering or priority-listing of word-classes for receiving Fo accent** in an utterance. Word classes in English display an accent-priority system where certain IC (Information Content) word classes at the high end are likely to receive strong Fo accent, whereas classes at the low end are likely to be completely de-accented.

**Tentative accent priority list** (from most to least likely to receive accent):
1. Sentential adverbs
2. Negatives
3. Interrogative pronouns
4. Dummy aux's in positive sentences
5. Quantifiers
6. Reflexive pronouns
7. 'A' modals (may, might, must)
8. Adjectives
9. Regular adverbs
10. Nouns
11. Negative contractions
12. Verbs
13. Demonstrative pronouns
14. Prepositions
15. Aux's (including 'B' modals: will, would, can)
16. Articles

### Modal Classification

**A modals** (receive more Fo accent): "may," "might," "must" - indicate speaker's feeling about the proposition (modality)

**B modals** (lower accent, like aux's): "will," "would," "can" - perform modulation rather than modality

### Phonetic Effects on Accent

Four main phonetic effects modify inherent accent tendencies:

1. **Position/Declination**: Accent and peak levels decreased as utterance progressed
2. **Separation**: Distance between accented syllables (ASs) affects accent levels; nearby ASs detract from each other
3. **Competition**: Presence of more ASs in an utterance decreased the accent of each
4. **Anticipation**: Speaker often 'anticipated' a longer utterance by raising initial Fo, and 'anticipated' more words by lowering Fo before the accent
5. **Carrier effect**: Peaks on ensuing words tend to be higher when following an accented word

### Contrastive Accent Shift

When a modal and negative occur sequentially, contrastive accent shift occurs:
- Main accent typically falls on the negative
- Secondary accent (at best) on the modal
- With accent shift, the negative is de-accented and the modal receives primary accent

### Compounds

In compounds (noun-noun, adjective-noun fixed combinations):
- Only the **first word** receives accent
- The 2 words are treated as a single unit with one 'lexically-stressed syllable'
- Compounds treat the first word as having the accent (indicative of English stress on initial syllable)
- Example: "steel factory" acted as compound; "cold facts" and "many factors" did not

### New vs. Old Information

The major semantic role that Fo plays is **highlighting the less predictable words** ('new information' words) via heavier Fo accent than on more predictable 'old information' words.

Key rules:
- **'New' words receive Fo accent; 'old' (repeated) ones do not**
- Old information = "foregrounded," "assumed to be in hearer's consciousness," having "low pitch and amplitude"
- Stress is inversely proportional to the operational 'total context' measure of redundancy

### Anaphora Effects

- Pronouns (personal, relative) usually receive little accent as function words
- Semi-pronouns like 'people,' 'things' often unstressed
- An NP introduced for the first time receives accent; second mention gets only secondary accent
- If no new NP in sentence, "the rhematic accent is automatically given to the verb"
- NPs with indefinite article receive stress; successive occurrences with definite article get de-accented

### Question-and-Answer Context

- In answer to a Wh-question, "the intonation center of the reply is on the interrogated constituent"
- Information "not given in the question and added to the reply" must be new information and "have their own intonation center(s)"
- Words mentioned in the question become 'old' in the answer and receive reduced accent

## Rules/Algorithms

### Accent Assignment Algorithm

1. Assign inherent accent based on word class (use accent priority list)
2. Apply phonetic modifications:
   - Reduce accent based on position (declination)
   - Adjust for separation from nearby accented syllables
   - Reduce for competition with other ASs
   - Apply anticipation effects for longer utterances
3. Apply semantic modifications:
   - Increase accent on 'new' information words
   - Decrease/eliminate accent on 'old' information words
   - Check for anaphoric relationships
4. Handle special cases:
   - Compounds: accent only first element
   - Contractions: intermediate accent level
   - Accent shift: when modal+negative, may shift accent to modal

### New/Old Information Rules

1. Words repeated in discourse are 'old' - reduce accent
2. Words in Q/A context mentioned in question are 'old' in answer
3. Pronouns referring to previously mentioned NPs get little accent
4. First mention with indefinite article = accented; definite article = de-accented
5. Parallel structures may increase accents despite repetition

### Contraction Rules

**Positive contractions** (aux-verb):
- Little change in Fo contour (other than time compression)
- Effect is deletion of syllable's Fo pattern

**Negative contractions** ("n't"):
- Fo rise shifts to preceding verbal
- Most likely because negative loses its vowel while aux does not
- Syllabic nasals ("-n't") never receive Fo accent
- "not" as MO carries significant linguistic information transferred to contracted word
- Accent decreases in negative contraction due to inherent de-emphasizing nature

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody System

1. **Word Class Tagging Required**: System needs POS tagging to assign base accent levels from priority list

2. **Accent Priority Implementation**:
   ```
   base_accent = {
     'sentential_adverb': 1.0,
     'negative': 0.95,
     'interrogative': 0.90,
     'dummy_aux': 0.85,
     'quantifier': 0.80,
     'reflexive_pronoun': 0.75,
     'A_modal': 0.70,  // may, might, must
     'adjective': 0.65,
     'regular_adverb': 0.60,
     'noun': 0.55,
     'negative_contraction': 0.50,
     'verb': 0.45,
     'demonstrative': 0.40,
     'preposition': 0.35,
     'B_modal': 0.30,  // will, would, can
     'aux': 0.25,
     'article': 0.10
   }
   ```

3. **Compound Detection**: Need to identify compound nouns/adjective-noun pairs and accent only first element

4. **New/Old Information Tracking**:
   - Track mentioned words/concepts in discourse
   - Reduce accent on repeated/anaphoric elements
   - Increase accent on first mentions

5. **Phonetic Adjustments**:
   - Apply declination (reduce peaks later in utterance)
   - Competition effect: more content words = less accent each
   - Separation: nearby accented syllables reduce each other

6. **Contraction Handling**:
   - Positive contractions: minimal Fo change
   - Negative contractions: shift accent to preceding word

7. **Modal Classification**:
   - A modals (may, might, must): higher accent
   - B modals (will, would, can, shall, should, could): lower accent, like aux's

8. **Q/A Context** (if implementing dialogue):
   - Track question content
   - Reduce accent on words from question appearing in answer
   - Increase accent on new information in answer
