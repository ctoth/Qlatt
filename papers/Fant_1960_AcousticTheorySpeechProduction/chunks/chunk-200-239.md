## Key Concepts

### Source Spectrum Characteristics for Fricatives/Stops (pp. 201-203)

Source spectrum envelope characteristics based on place of articulation:

| Source Type | Spectrum Envelope | Applicable Frequency Range |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| [x] | -6 dB/octave (pressure/voltage) | 300-4000 c/s |
| [f] | -6 dB/octave, white noise for continuant + step function for transient | 800-10000 c/s (better fit: source envelope of -3 dB/octave) |
| [f.] | Explosion phase + noise interval [k k, p p,] | 400-8000 c/s |
| [s] | 0 dB/octave ("flat" spectrum) | 300-6000 c/s assuming apical source, except 300-800 c/s uncertainty |
| [s] | 0 dB/octave | 300-2000 c/s assuming dental source with -12 dB/octave fall above 2000 c/s |
| [s2] | 300-3000 c/s followed by -6 dB/octave above 3000 c/s (dental source assumed) |
| [s2] | 1500-8000 c/s assuming constriction source |
| [s] | 800-4000 c/s followed by -6 dB/octave above 4000 c/s |
| [s.] | 1000-8000 c/s |
| [f] and [t.] | 500-8000 c/s for the fricative interval |

### Constriction Cutoff Frequency

$$
F_c = v/2\pi l
$$

Where:
- v = air velocity (typically 3000 cm/s)
- l = constriction length
- For dental/palatal fricatives: l = 2.5 cm, so F_c ~ 200 c/s (shorter labial passages: ~500 c/s)

### Source Voltage Equation (p. 202)

$$
U_s(\omega) = E_s(\omega)/(R_s + j\omega L_s)
$$

Where:
- U_s(w) = source voltage
- E_s(w) = equivalent circuit voltage
- R_s = resistance (dependent on airflow, R_s/L_s ratio increases with flow)
- L_s = inductance of constriction

### Source Location Effects

- Glottal source: emphasizes F1; labial source: emphasizes F3 or F4
- Palatal source: emphasizes F2
- Dental source: front location causes equally spaced poles and zeros
- For labial+palatal combination: labial source position indicated by zero at ~1300 c/s

## F-Pattern and Articulation (Section 3.2)

### Three-Parameter Vowel Description System

Three parameters for specifying vowel F-patterns (Stevens and House 1955, 1956):
1. Place of tongue constriction
2. Cross-sectional area of tongue constriction
3. Degree of lip opening

Key relationships:
- Vowel [i]: F1 = 500 c/s, F2 = 1500 c/s, F3 = 2500 c/s (neutral position)
- High F1: tongue pass in back (pharynx) or lip narrowing
- High F2: tongue pass at middle of front half (palatal region)
- F1 increases with tongue pass opening; F2 decreases with lip narrowing/lengthening

### Formant-Cavity Affiliations

For back vowels:
- F1: back cavity affiliation with some front cavity contribution
- F2: front cavity affiliation

For [u]:
- F1: mainly influenced by back cavity and lip orifice
- F2: front cavity + tongue pass (sum larger than back cavity contribution to F1)
- F2 of [u] is a back resonator formant; F1 is front resonator formant

For [i]:
- F1-back-cavity and F2-front-cavity affiliations apply well
- No marked tongue constriction = equal formant dependency on all cavities

## Distinctive Features (Sections 3.3-3.4)

### Jakobson-Halle Feature Definitions with Acoustic Correlates

| Feature | Acoustic Definition | Genetic (Articulatory) Definition |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| vocalic/non-vocalic | presence vs. absence of sharply defined formant structure | primary/only excitation at glottis with free passage through vocal tract |
| consonantal/non-consonantal | low vs. high total energy | presence vs. absence of obstruction in vocal tract |
| compact/diffuse | higher vs. lower concentration of energy in narrow central spectrum region; increase vs. decrease of total energy | forward-flanged vs. backward-flanged; volume of resonance chamber in front of narrowest stricture |
| grave/acute | concentration of energy in lower vs. upper frequencies | peripheral vs. medial phonemes (velar/labial vs. palatal/dental) |
| flat/plain | downward shift of upper frequency components | decreased back/front orifice of mouth resonator + widened pharynx |
| sharp/plain | upward shift of upper frequency components | dilated pharyngeal pass + widened back orifice via palatalization |
| tense/lax | higher vs. lower total energy with greater vs. smaller spread in spectrum and time | greater vs. smaller muscular strain deforming vocal tract from rest |
| strident/mellow | higher vs. lower intensity noise | rough-edged vs. smooth-edged articulation |

### F2-Shift Data for Plain vs. Sharp Consonants (p. 223)

| Consonant Type | F2 (c/s) | F4 (c/s) |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Plain labials** | | |
| Calculated | 800 | 2250 |
| Measured | 920 | 2025 |
| **Sharp labials** | | |
| Calculated | 1800 | 2400 |
| Measured | 1820 | 2400 |
| **Plain dentals** | | |
| Calculated | 1370 | 2640 |
| Measured | 1440 | (not accurate) |
| **Sharp dentals** | | |
| Calculated | 1900 | 3050 |
| Measured | 1700 | (not accurate) |
| **Plain [k]** | | |
| Calculated | 1200 | 2800 |
| Measured | 1425 | 2600 |
| **Sharp [k']** | | |
| Calculated | 2200 | 2900 |
| Measured | 1800 | 2700 |

Average F2 shift from plain to sharp: ~1000 c/s for labials

### Tense vs. Lax Stop Factors (p. 225)

Three factors differentiating tense stops from lax stops:
1. Static over-pressure before explosion (tense has higher)
2. Instant of vocal cord closure for following voiced sound (latency)
3. Speed of articulatory movements (time in position for fricative noise)

## Equations Found

### Sound Intensity (p. 228)

$$
W = P^2 / \rho c \quad \text{erg-sec}^{-1}/\text{cm}^2
$$

Where:
- W = sound intensity
- P = r.m.s. sound pressure (dynes/cm^2)
- rho = air density (g/cm^3)
- c = velocity of propagation (cm/sec)
- rho*c = specific acoustical resistance = 41.4 dynes sec/cm^3 at 20C, 40.0 at 35C

### Sound Intensity Level (p. 229)

$$
L = 10 \log_{10}(W/W_0) \quad \text{dB}
$$

Which equals sound pressure level:

$$
L = 20 \log_{10}(P/P_0) \quad \text{dB}
$$

Where:
- P_0 = 0.0002 dynes/cm^2 (standardized reference)
- W_0 = 10^-16 watt/cm^2

### Exponential Memory Function (p. 232)

$$
h(t) = h_0 e^{-t/RC}
$$

Where:
- h_0 = peak of memory
- T_d = RC (delay time)
- T_a = e*RC (averaging time)

### Averaging Time (p. 232)

$$
T_a = 1/2B
$$

Where B = cutoff frequency of low-pass filter

### Band-pass Filter Output (p. 235)

$$
v_m(t) = V_m(t) \cos[\omega_m t + \phi_m(t)]
$$

Where:
- V_m(t) = amplitude information
- phi_m(t) = phase information
- omega_m = 2*pi*F_m (center frequency)

## Vocal Tract Models

### Source Location Model

The source location affects which formants are emphasized:
- **Glottal source**: emphasizes F1 (low frequencies)
- **Labial source**: emphasizes F3 or F4 (high frequencies due to short front cavity)
- **Palatal source**: emphasizes F2 (mid frequencies)
- **Dental source**: extreme front location causes equally-spaced poles/zeros

### Helmholtz Resonator Application

- Single Helmholtz resonator: applicable for F1 of back vowels and [i]
- Double Helmholtz resonator: for F1 and F2 prediction of back vowels
- Front cavity of [i] conditions F3 more than F2 and F4

## Formant Data

### Formant Transitions for Russian Consonants (Fig. 3.4-1, p. 220)

Shows F-pattern variations in vowel [a] following various consonants:
- Voiced and voiceless sounds paired and synchronized to articulation timing
- Arrows indicate when articulators begin moving away from closure
- For [d,a] and [t,a]: [t_s] must start earlier due to longer fricative interval
- [g] and [k] start at same time (equal articulatory speed)
- Burst explosion occurs 70 msec after for [k] (unvoiced)

### Calculated F-Patterns of Russian Consonants (Fig. 3.4-2, p. 221)

Shows calculated formant patterns with:
- No F3 differentiation undertaken
- Zeros of nasals and liquids indicated by circles
- Systematic organization by place/manner

## Implementation Notes

### Source Spectrum Modeling for Fricatives

For fricative synthesis, use these source spectrum slopes:
- **[s], [z]**: Flat (0 dB/octave) from ~1000-8000 Hz
- **[f], [v]**: -6 dB/octave from ~800-10000 Hz
- **[x]**: -6 dB/octave from ~300-4000 Hz

The constriction cutoff frequency F_c = v/(2*pi*l) determines the low-frequency rolloff.

### Formant Measurement Considerations

- Formant frequency: measured as envelope maximum frequency position
- Formant level: envelope level in dB at the peak
- Formant bandwidth: distance at 3 dB below envelope peak
- When F_0 > B (formant bandwidth), intensity level = sum of harmonic intensities within formant

### Integration Time for Analysis

- For F0 measurement: ~10 msec integration
- For intensity: ~250 msec (VU-type) or 50 msec for bursts
- The auditory system has different time constants for different aspects (pitch vs. loudness vs. timbre)

### Distinctive Feature Implementation

For synthesis control:
- **Compact vs. Diffuse**: Control mid-frequency energy concentration (high F1 = compact)
- **Grave vs. Acute**: Control low vs. high frequency emphasis (F2 < 1000 Hz = grave)
- **Sharp vs. Plain**: Shift all formants upward ~1000 Hz via palatalization
- **Tense vs. Lax**: Increase energy, duration, and spectral spread

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The especially good fit between the calculated and spoken [x]-spectra may be due to a fairly accurate localization of the source at the constriction center during spurious closure and opening movements of the articulators caused by the Bernouilli force of the outflowing air. The -6 dB/octave source found to be representative for [x] up to 3000 c/s may thus originate from the impact of these spurious air quanta." (p. 201)

> "The F-pattern, specified continuously along the speech utterance, serves as a generalized locus or hub concept since it includes not only F2 but also F1 and F3 and those higher resonance frequencies which may be needed in any special case." (p. 209)

> "Sharply defined formant structure may be explained as the physical materialization of the F-pattern, i.e., of F1, F2, and F3, and the dominance of this part of the formant structure versus other formants or formant regions such as the superimposed noise of voiced fricatives and stops and further the nasality characteristics of nasal consonants." (p. 215)

> "A formant in the frequency domain is mathematically identical with a damped oscillation in the time domain. If this had been quite clear 50 years ago, the classical Helmholtz theory and the Hermann-Willis theory of speech production would never have been opposed to each other as being different." (p. 237)

> "Human speech covers an intensity range of about 30 dB. Vowels carrying a main stress have a sound pressure level of approximately 65 dB at one meter's conversational distance (Dunn and White, 1940), and the unvoiced consonants are on the average 20 dB weaker (Fant, 1949)." (p. 229)
