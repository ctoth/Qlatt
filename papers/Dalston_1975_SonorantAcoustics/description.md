This paper provides comprehensive spectrographic measurements of formant frequencies, steady-state durations, transition durations, and transition rates for English /w/, /r/, and /l/ sonorants in children and adults. Key findings include that F2 distinguishes /w/ from /l/ and /r/, F3 frequency distinguishes /r/ from /w/ and /l/, and /l/ is marked by longer steady-state duration, abrupt F1 transitions, and occasional transient clicks. These acoustic characteristics are directly applicable to formant synthesis parameters, particularly for correctly modeling the very low F3 of /r/, the extended duration of /l/, and the rapid F1 transitions characteristic of lateral consonants.
