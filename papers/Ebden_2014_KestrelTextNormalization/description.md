Kestrel is Google's production text normalization system that converts non-standard words (numbers, dates, abbreviations, currency) into speakable text using weighted finite-state transducers with a novel two-phase architecture. The system separates tokenization and classification from verbalization using protocol buffers as an intermediate representation, enabling automatic handling of word reordering and supporting 19+ languages with shared universal rules. This modular approach is critical for speech synthesis systems because text normalization errors are immediately noticeable to listeners regardless of voice quality, and Kestrel's lattice-based grammar framework provides a scalable, deployable solution tested on hundreds of millions of Android devices.
