# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Vowel reduction has been studied for years. It is a universal phenomenon that reduces the distinction of vowels in informal speech and unstressed syllables. How consonants behave in situations where vowels are reduced is much less well known. In this paper we compare durational and spectral data (for both intervocalic consonants and vowels) segmented from read speech with otherwise identical segments from spontaneous speech. On a global level, it shows that consonants reduce like vowels when the speaking style becomes informal. On a more detailed level there are differences related to the type of the consonant.

## Our Interpretation

This paper establishes that consonant reduction parallels vowel reduction when speech becomes more spontaneous and informal, affecting multiple acoustic dimensions simultaneously. The key finding is that reduction is a global phenomenon affecting both vowels and consonants similarly in duration and spectral energy, though the details vary by consonant type. For speech synthesis, this suggests that consonant acoustic parameters must be adjusted in parallel with vowel reduction parameters during informal/reduced speech generation, rather than treating them independently.
