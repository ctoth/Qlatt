This paper experimentally determines the minimum durations of frication noise required for perceptual identification of English fricatives ([f, s, θ, ʃ, v, z, ð]), using edited natural CV syllables presented to listeners in identification tasks. Key findings show that sibilants [ʃ, z] require only 30 ms for ~70% accuracy while labiodentals [f, v] require 50 ms, dentals [θ, ð] require full frication to be identified clearly, and critically, place-of-articulation cues require much longer durations (~70 ms) than voicing cues (~20 ms). These results directly inform Klatt synthesis by establishing minimum frication duration thresholds to avoid unnatural degradation of fricative quality and by revealing that gradual amplitude rise—rather than raw intensity—is the acoustic cue that distinguishes fricatives from stops.
