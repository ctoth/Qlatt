## Key Findings

### From Chapter III (F0 Fluctuations)
- The '1&A' pattern of pitch movements (rise-fall on single syllable) is the most frequently used pattern across all seven emotions studied
- No one-to-one relationship exists between intonation pattern and emotion
- Six anchor points were measured per utterance to capture F0 variations:
  1. Onset of voiced speech (baseline start)
  2. Initial-accent peak
  3. Point after initial-accent peak (valley region)
  4. Point before final-accent peak (valley region)
  5. Final-accent peak
  6. F0 at end of voiced speech
- Three emotion groups distinguishable by pitch characteristics:
  - Low pitch level, narrow range: neutrality, boredom
  - High pitch level (raised baseline): fear, sadness
  - Large pitch range with raised baseline: anger, indignation
  - Moderately raised pitch with enlarged range: joy

### From Chapter IV (Intonation Patterns)
- IPO (Institute for Perception Research) model of Dutch intonation was used to label pitch curves
- The IPO grammar defines 10 basic pitch movements characterized by:
  1. Timing in the syllable
  2. Spread over one or more syllables
  3. Size (full or half)
- Main grammatically correct patterns for Dutch:
  - '1&A' (pointed hat): rise and fall on single accented syllable
  - '1A' (rise on accented syllable, fall on next)
  - '1B' (rise on accented syllable and early fall before phonological boundary)
  - '1D' (rise on accented syllable and gradual fall)
  - '5A' (overshoot after rise and full fall)
  - '1EA' (rise, half fall, and fall)
  - '12' (rise followed by very late rise)
  - '1C' (rise and very late fall)
  - '3C' (late rise and very late fall)
  - '45&A' (slow rise with overshoot and full fall)

## F0/Prosody Patterns

### Two-Component Intonation Model
The classical two-component model describes F0 curves in terms of:
1. **Pitch level**: How high/low utterance is in speaker's overall range (represented by end-point of baseline)
2. **Pitch range**: Distance between baseline and topline (peaks)

Extended model adds notion of **'floor'**: basic pitch level at which speaker feels at ease, for describing parts of curve lower than baseline.

### Emotion-Specific F0 Patterns (Table 9, page 84)

| Emotion | End Freq (Hz) | Pitch Range (st) | Final Position |
|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Neutrality | 65-95 | 5-6 | Normal low |
| Joy | 125-155 | 10-12 | High, enlarged range |
| Boredom | 65-100 | 4-5 | Low, narrow range |
| Anger | 110-145 | 8-10 | Large range |
| Sadness | 103-125 | 7-8 | Raised baseline |
| Fear | 160-200 | 8-9 | High baseline |
| Indignation | 170-180 | 9-10 | Large range, raised baseline |

### Pitch Movement Timing (Table 4, page 105)

| Movement | Beginning | Duration | Excursion |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | vo - 70 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range |
| 2 (initial) | eov - 120 ms | 100 ms | Pitch range + 3 s.t. |
| 2 (final) | vo of last syllable + 20 ms | 80 ms | Pitch range x 2 |
| 3 | vo | 80 ms | Pitch range |
| 5 | vo - 70 ms | 60 ms | Pitch range x 0.5 |
| A (in 1&A) | vo + 80 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range |
| A (in 1A) | vo - 20 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range |
| A (in 1EA) | vo of last syl - 70 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range x 0.5 |
| A (in 15A) | vo + 40 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range x 1.5 |
| B | vo of next syl - 110 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range |
| C | vo of last syl + 70 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range |
| E | vo - 70 ms | 120 ms | Pitch range x 0.5 |

Where: vo = vowel onset, eov = end of voicing

## Voice Quality Parameters
- Voice source parameters mentioned as important for emotion but not manipulated in the F0 studies
- Speech rate and voice quality noted as needing separate investigation for full emotional expression

## Formant Data
No formant data in this chunk - focuses exclusively on F0/prosody.

## Klatt Synthesizer Details
No direct Klatt synthesizer mentions. The synthesis used PSOLA technique (Moulines and Laroche, 1995) for pitch manipulation while keeping segmental durations unchanged.

## Figures of Interest

- **Figure 5 (page 76/87):** Schematized pitch curves averaged over all utterances per speaker and per emotion - shows F0 (Hz) vs anchor points (1-6) for speakers MR, RS, LO
- **Figure 6 (page 77/88):** Schematized pitch curves averaged over utterances with '1&A' pattern of pitch movements

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "There appears to be no one-to-one relationship between intonation pattern and emotion. The most frequent pattern of pitch movements, '1&A', can be used in the expression of all emotions under study." (page 72/83)

> "In a two-component model, one component relates to variations in pitch level. The notion of pitch level represents how high or low an utterance is produced in the speaker's overall range." (page 78/89)

> "For boredom, it does not come as a surprise that, for this emotion, it is the absence of variations, and thus the absence of modeling, that is relevant, particularly the absence of final lowering." (page 86/97)

> "Small differences of less than 30 ms in timing and duration of a pitch movement, could sometimes mean the absence or presence of an accent." (page 104/115)

> "The start and the end of voicing are suggested as the perceptual reference points for timing pitch movements within the syllables." (page 104/115)

## Implementation Notes

### Synthesizing Emotional F0 Contours

1. **Baseline declination**: Use constant 3.5 semitones/second decline from utterance onset
2. **Anchor point approach**: Measure/synthesize F0 at 6 key points:
   - Point 1: Speech onset (baseline start)
   - Point 2: First accent peak
   - Point 3: Valley after first accent
   - Point 4: Valley before final accent
   - Point 5: Final accent peak
   - Point 6: Speech end

3. **Emotion-specific modifications**:
   - **Neutrality/Boredom**: Low end frequency (65-100 Hz), narrow range (4-6 st)
   - **Joy**: High end frequency (125-155 Hz), wide range (10-12 st), raised baseline
   - **Anger**: Moderate end frequency (110-145 Hz), wide range (8-10 st)
   - **Fear/Sadness**: High end frequency (103-200 Hz), moderate range (7-9 st), raised baseline
   - **Indignation**: High end frequency (170-180 Hz), wide range (9-10 st)

4. **Pitch movement timing** (relative to vowel onset):
   - Rise '1': starts 70 ms before vowel onset, duration 120 ms
   - Fall 'A' (in 1&A): starts 80 ms after vowel onset, duration 120 ms
   - Excursion size: typically equals the pitch range for that emotion

### Pattern Selection for Emotion Synthesis
- Use '1&A' (pointed hat) as default pattern - works for all emotions
- For indignation: prefer patterns ending in 'C' (late fall) or '2' (late rise)
- For neutrality/boredom: avoid 'A' pattern after initial rise, prefer '1' alone
- Patterns ending in '2' or 'C' were never used in neutral speech

### Key Insight for TTS
The same intonation pattern ('1&A') can express all seven emotions when combined with appropriate pitch level and pitch range. Emotion is conveyed more through global F0 characteristics (level, range) than through specific local pitch movements.
