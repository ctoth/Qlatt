## Key Findings

### Vowel Reduction and Schwa
- Vowel reduction target is high central [i] (Veatch 1991)
- Coronal environment on left and right is most favorable for [i] realization
- Following [+coronal] environment more favorable than preceding [+coronal]

### /u/ Fronting
- Fronted [u] allophone predicted most often in contexts with coronals on both sides
- Preceding coronal environment alone is next best predictor
- Neural network accuracy: 86% with coronals on both sides, 67% with [+cor] preceding only

### Glottalization of Word-Initial Vowels
- 21% glottalized in original speech, 14% by postlexical neural network
- 72% accuracy among vowels glottalized by neural network
- Vowels in accented syllables more likely to be glottalized (48% vs 45%)
- Prosodic boundaries important: 21% at start of intermediate phrases, 14% at intonational phrases

### /t/ Allophony (Critical for TTS)
- /t/ and /d/ have the most entropy of any consonants except schwa
- **Deletion**: Only occurs when /t/ is final element of consonant cluster in syllable coda
- **Flapping**: Only in intervocalic environments (V_V)
- **Glottalization**: Primarily before sonorants
- **Unreleased/unaspirated**: Before nonsonorants
- **Aspirated /t/**: Generally at ends of intonational phrases

### t,d Deletion Analysis (OCP-based)
- Deletion favored after segments matching /t,d/ featurally
- /t,d/ characterized as [+coronal, -sonorant, -continuant]
- Two-feature matches (n, sibilants) show less deletion than one-feature matches
- Deletion rates by preceding phone:
  - n [+cor,-cont]: 42% in original, 33% by neural net
  - p,b,k,g [-son,-cont]: 22% original, 33% neural net
  - s,z,S,Z,tS,dZ [+cor,-son]: 8% original, 4% neural net

### Flapping Performance
- Neural network: 9 correct applications, 3 incorrect, 2 failures
- Flapping occurs in classic V_V environment
- Failures in cross-word environments: "that heavy", "brought out"

### Glottalization of /t/ by Environment
- Before sonorants (n,m,r,j,w): Primary environment
- Glottalization by prosodic position:
  - Non-phrase-final (N=13): 9 original, 10 neural net (46% correct)
  - End of intermediate phrase (N=2): 1 original, 2 neural net (50% correct)
  - End of intonational phrase (N=10): 4 original, 6 neural net (0% correct)
- Accented syllables: 33% neural net accuracy vs 25% unaccented

### Function Word Reduction (The, To, A)
- **"the"**: Lax [a] or [i] before consonants, tense [i] before vowels
- Phonologically-conditioned allomorphy: /i/ -> [a] / __C
- Neural network learned this distinction well from lexical /Di/
- **"to"**: Before vowels, reduced half as often as unreduced; before consonants, reduced 2x more than unreduced
- **"a"**: 75% likelihood of NOT being reduced at phrase-initial position

### Dialect Phenomena
- **/M/ voicing**: Distinction between "which" [MItS] and "witch" [wItS] recessive in modern dialects
- **Vowels before /r/**: Lexorola distinguishes marry /maeri/, Mary /meri/, merry /mEri/ but these are only common in Eastern US
- **Low back merger**: caught/cot distinction difficult to maintain consistently in lexicon
- **Stem-final tensing**: Underlying /I/ becomes [i] in certain environments (city, cities, city hall, happiness)
  - Prefix examples: be-, pre-, re- all show schwa -> [i] tensing

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The process is universally variable in English-- that is, every speaker that has been observed deletes some, but not all, of their final stops." (p. 192, citing Guy and Boberg 1997)

> "It is important to note that the concept of t,d 'deletion' is somewhat of an abstraction. It is likely that a more precise analysis might find remnants of the /t/ or /d/ gesture in the remaining consonant" (p. 192)

> "The construction of complete grammars for 'idiolects', even one's own, is a fruitless and unrewarding task; we now know enough about language in its social context to realize that the grammar of the speech community is more regular and systematic than the behavior of any one individual." (p. 210, citing Labov 1972, 124)

> "We believe that successful speech applications must strive for human-like competency in order to be accepted by humans. We also believe that attaining human-like competency cannot be achieved without adopting human-like methods in the conversion between text and linguistic representation." (p. 215)

## Implementation Notes

### /t/ Allophony Rules for TTS
1. **Deletion**: Apply when /t,d/ is word-final after another consonant
2. **Flapping**: Apply in V_V context (intervocalic)
3. **Glottalization**: Apply before sonorants (n, m, r, l, w, j) and at phrase boundaries
4. **Aspiration**: Apply at intonational phrase ends and syllable-initially
5. Consider prosodic position for allophone selection

### Function Word Processing
- Store both reduced and unreduced forms in lexicon
- Apply phonological conditioning: "the" -> [Da] before C, [Di] before V
- Consider phrase-initial position for "a" reduction

### Dialect Adaptation
- /M/-/w/ merger is standard in most modern American English
- Vowel+/r/ distinctions (marry/Mary/merry) limited to Eastern US
- Low back merger (caught/cot) increasingly common
- Stem-final tensing in be-, pre-, re- prefixes

### Lexical Representation for Speech Recognition
- Multiple phonetic pronunciations with likelihoods improve accuracy
- Single phonemic: 93.4% accuracy
- Single phonetic: 94.1% accuracy
- Multiple phonetic with likelihoods: 96.3% accuracy

### TIMIT/IPA Mapping (from Table A-1)
Key correspondences for implementation:
- p,t,k,b,d,g = IPA p,t,k,b,d,g
- th,dh = IPA theta, eth
- ch,jh = IPA tS, dZ
- sh = IPA S
- ah = IPA Lambda
- ae = IPA ae
- aa = IPA a (open back)
- ao = IPA open-o
- ax = IPA schwa
