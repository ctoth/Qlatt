This paper proposes a codebook-based glottal source model that links LSF (vocal tract) parameters to normalized glottal waveforms, demonstrating that glottal wave shape is predictable from phonetic class within a speaker. The key finding is that clustering vocal tract parameters into 9 classes and selecting representative glottal derivatives achieves 27-30% higher correlation with original glottal waveforms and 50% lower spectral distance compared to LF and Rosenberg parametric models. For Klatt synthesis, this validates the principle that phoneme class strongly predicts glottal characteristics, suggesting that voice source parameters could be automatically varied by phoneme category rather than held constant across an utterance.
