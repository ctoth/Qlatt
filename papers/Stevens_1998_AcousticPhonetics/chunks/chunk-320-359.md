## Key Findings

### Nasalization Effects (p. 320-322)
- Nasalized /e/ shows widened first-formant prominence, nasal resonance at ~1000 Hz, and a zero at higher frequency
- Nasalization effect stronger for /e/ than /o/; differences in velopharyngeal opening control
- French has heavily nasalized vowels compared to English (smaller velopharyngeal opening in English)

### Stop Consonant Overview (p. 323-324)
- Three time intervals define phonetic features in speech:
  1. Intervals when vocal tract is constricted
  2. Points when there is release from or implosion toward constriction
  3. Time intervals with no narrow constriction
- Stop consonant production involves closure, closure interval, and release
- Closure duration minima: 200-300 ms between successive maxima

### Articulatory Movements (p. 324-325)
- Cross-sectional area at implosion/release changes at rate of 40-100 cm^2/s
- Constriction length: few mm for lips/tongue tip, 1-2 cm for tongue body
- Rate of area change: ~25 cm^2/s for tongue body closures, ~50 cm^2/s for labials

### Aerodynamic Properties (p. 326-328)
- Prior to 3-10 ms before implosion: supraglottal movements have no major influence on glottal vibration
- Immediately following closure: pressure buildup behind constriction
- Intraoral pressure increases to within 2 cm H2O of subglottal pressure (~6 cm H2O) in about 20 ms
- Glottal area increases from 0.04 cm^2 to about 0.14 cm^2 during closure
- Average outward wall displacement: ~1 mm for 8 cm H2O intraoral pressure
- Wall displacement greater in pharyngeal/dorsum regions, less in hard palate

### Glottal Vibration During Closure (p. 333)
- Glottal vibration continues for 25 ms following closure with reduced amplitude (-10 dB relative to vowel)
- Voicing continuation time: 50-100 ms before pressure equilibrates
- Experimental values: voiced closure can last 10-20 ms with low-amplitude pulses

### Low-Frequency Sound Output (p. 331-340)
- During closure, lowest natural frequency ~200 Hz (180 Hz with partially open glottis)
- Flow pulses proportional to P_trans^1.5 where P_trans = P_s - P_m (transglottal pressure)
- F1 falls prior to closure over ~10-20 ms for labials, ~50 ms for velars
- At instant of closure, F1 frequency at about 200 Hz, sound radiated from face/neck surfaces

### Initial Transient at Release (p. 330)
- Initial volume flow transient given by equation 7.1:
  $U(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2P_o}{\rho}} A_c(t)$
  where P_o = intraoral pressure at release, A_c(t) = cross-sectional area
- When A_c(t) < 0.05 cm^2, viscous resistance dominates dynamic resistance

### F1 Trajectories (p. 335)
- Labial closure: F1 trajectory complete in ~10 ms; initial release ~10 ms prior to opening
- Velar closure: F1 trajectory takes ~50 ms to complete; rate of area change slower
- Calculated F1 rises from ~200 Hz at release to ~600 Hz for labials, slower for velars

### High-Frequency Sound Output (p. 340-359)

#### General Description (p. 340)
- At closure: abrupt decrease in voicing amplitude, glottal pulses with decreasing amplitude
- At release: brief burst of noise, transient, formant trajectories, possible aspiration noise
- Acoustic events depend on place of articulation

#### Labial Stop Consonants (p. 340-353)

**Formant Transitions:**
- For back vowels (/a/, /u/): two-tube resonator model applies
  - A1 = 0.7 cm^2, A2 = 7.0 cm^2, overall length 17 cm
  - Lowest coupled resonances: 800 Hz and 1180 Hz
- First three formants increase from 0 to 7 cm^2 at rate of 100 cm^2/s
- F1 shows rapid rise; F2 rises slowly for front vowels, falls for back vowels
- Most F1 movement completed in 20 ms or less
- F2 movement extensive and rapid after labial release into front vowel

**Spectral Characteristics:**
- Spectrum amplitude decreases at high frequencies rapidly in first few ms prior to closure
- A 500-250 Hz decrease in F1 results in ~12 dB decrease in high-frequency amplitude
- At closure: glottal source at glottis, frication source in oral cavity vicinity
- Brief interval of low-amplitude pulses insufficient for voiced perception (K. N. Stevens et al., 1992)
- At release: transglottal pressure reaches 3 cm H2O after 2-15 ms depending on release rate
- Sequence of acoustic events (Figure 7.17):
  1. Initial brief pulse of volume velocity
  2. Burst of turbulence/frication at constriction
  3. Turbulence/aspiration at glottis
  4. Onset of vocal fold vibration
  5. Further lip/tongue movement toward vowel configuration

**Calculated Spectra (Figure 7.18):**
- T: Initial transient at consonant release (300-Hz bands, 20 cm distance)
- F: Frication noise at labial constriction
- A: Sound after aspiration onset near glottis
- V: Vowel spectrum after vocal fold vibration onset
- Turbulence noise maximum 1-2 ms after release, decreases by ~8 dB over 6 ms
- Sound pressure at 1 kHz: ~13 dB re 1 dyne/cm^2 in 300-Hz band at 300 Hz

#### Alveolar Stop Consonants (p. 355-361)

**Formant Transitions:**
- Closure formed at point 1.5-2.5 cm posterior to lip opening
- Classified as [+anterior, -distributed]
- Rate of cross-sectional area increase: ~50 cm^2/s (slower than labial ~100 cm^2/s)
- Tongue tip contact causes tapering of area behind constriction
- For front vowel: little F2 movement, slow F1 rise and fall
- For back vowel: F2 decreases as tongue body moves back, continuing F1 rise
- Two-component formant movement:
  1. Rapid upward F1, F2, F3 as tongue tip releases (first 10 ms)
  2. Slower downward F2 movement for back vowel (tongue body motion)
- Front cavity length: 1.5-2.5 cm
- Front-cavity resonance: 4.5 kHz for 1.5 cm cavity, bandwidth ~600 Hz

**Spectral Characteristics:**
- Short front cavity anterior to constriction (vs. no cavity for labials)
- Transfer function has pole at front-cavity resonance frequency
- Alveolar release rate: 50 cm^2/s (vs. 100 cm^2/s for labials)
- Transient spectrum reduced by 6 dB relative to labial transient
- Front-cavity resonance ~4.5 kHz with 600 Hz bandwidth

## Equations Found

### Initial Transient Volume Flow (Eq. 7.1)
$$U(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2P_o}{\rho}} A_c(t)$$
- $P_o$ = intraoral pressure at release
- $\rho$ = air density
- $A_c(t)$ = cross-sectional area of constriction

### Sound Pressure at Lips (Eq. 7.2)
$$p_{H}(f) = \frac{f\rho U_t(f)}{2r}$$
- $U_t(f)$ = volume velocity spectrum of transient
- $r$ = distance from lips
- At 1 kHz, r = 20 cm: ~56 dB re 0.0002 dyne/cm^2

### Volume Velocity at Constriction (Eq. 7.3)
$$U_o = \frac{p_s}{2\pi f M_c} = \frac{p_s A_c}{2\pi f \rho \ell_c}$$
- $M_c = \rho\ell_c/A_c$ = acoustic mass of constriction
- $A_c$ = cross-sectional area
- $\ell_c$ = constriction length

### Sound Pressure at Distance r (Eq. 7.4)
$$p_r = \frac{\rho f}{2r} \cdot U_o$$

### Radiated Sound Pressure (Eq. 7.5)
$$p_r = \frac{A_c}{4\pi r \ell_c} \cdot p_s$$

- F3 follows similar rapid rise
- F1 rise less extensive for front vowels than back vowels

## Rules/Algorithms

### Sequence of Acoustic Events at Stop Release (Figure 7.17)
1. **Initial transient** (0-1 ms): Brief pulse of volume velocity from rapid area increase
2. **Turbulence/frication burst** (1-5 ms): Generated at constriction as walls return
3. **Aspiration noise** (5-15 ms): Turbulence generated at glottis
4. **Voicing onset** (2-15 ms): Vocal fold vibration begins when transglottal pressure sufficient
5. **Formant movements** (0-40 ms): Articulator movements toward vowel configuration

### Formant Transition Calculation Algorithm
1. Start with constriction area A_c = 0
2. Assume linear increase: A_c = A_max(1 - e^(-t/tau)) where:
   - tau = 1/100 s for labials
   - tau = 1/25 s for velars
   - tau = 1/50 s for alveolars
3. Calculate natural frequencies from tube model at each time step
4. Apply rate of change limits: 50% completion time indicates transition speed

### Amplitude Envelope Calculation
- Prior to closure: A1 decreases as F1 drops (transfer function peak effect)
- At closure: Abrupt decrease in voicing amplitude
- During closure: Residual voicing ~10 dB below vowel level
- At release: Multiple sources contribute (transient, frication, aspiration)
- Amplitude proportional to 20 log(U^3 A_c^-2.5) for turbulence

### Source Amplitude Time Course (Figure 7.16)
- A1, A2, A3, A4 all decrease as closure approaches (40 ms to 0)
- Higher formants decrease first
- A1 remains near vowel level until final 10 ms
- Recovery after release mirrors implosion pattern

> "There are three classes of time intervals during which properties of the speech wave can contribute to the identity of phonetic features: (1) intervals when the vocal tract is constricted, (2) points in time when there is a release from a constriction or an implosion toward a constriction, and (3) time intervals when there is no narrow constriction in the vocal tract."

> "The sequence of acoustic events following the consonantal release has been described by Fant (1973a), and is summarized in schematic form in figure 7.17. The sequence consists of (1) an initial brief pulse of volume velocity; (2) a burst of turbulence or frication noise at the constriction as the expanded walls of the vocal tract return to their rest position; (3) a possible brief time interval in which turbulence or aspiration noise is generated at the glottis; (4) onset of vocal fold vibration as the supraglottal pressure decreases and the vocal folds move inward; and (5) further movement of the lips and tongue body..."

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Stop Closure Modeling:**
   - Set F1 to ~200 Hz during closure
   - Reduce voicing amplitude by ~10 dB during closure
   - Closure duration affects perceived voicing: <25 ms maintains voicing character

2. **Formant Transition Rates:**
   - Labial: Complete F1 transition in 10-20 ms, rapid F2/F3 changes
   - Alveolar: Initial 10 ms rapid rise, then slower F2 movement
   - Velar: Slowest transitions, ~50 ms for F1

3. **Burst Generation:**
   - Labial: No front cavity, burst spectrum relatively flat
   - Alveolar: Front cavity resonance at ~4.5 kHz, burst energy concentrated there
   - Use turbulence noise source with appropriate spectral shaping

4. **Amplitude Contours (Figure 7.16 data):**
   - A1 (F1 amplitude): Stable until 10 ms before closure, then drops
   - A2-A4: Begin dropping 40 ms before closure
   - At release: All amplitudes rise, higher formants lead

5. **Release Event Sequence (critical timing):**
   - t=0: Initial transient (brief volume pulse)
   - t=1-2 ms: Peak turbulence/frication noise
   - t=2-15 ms: Onset of voicing (rate-dependent)
   - t=0-40 ms: Formant transitions toward vowel

6. **Source Amplitude Modeling:**
   - Turbulence noise: 20 log(U^3 A_c^-2.5)
   - Maximum at 1-2 ms after release
   - Decay: ~8 dB over 6 ms

7. **Vocal Tract Configuration:**
   - For /p,b/: All formants resonances of back cavity only
   - For /t,d/: Front cavity (1.5-2.5 cm) adds high-frequency pole at ~4.5 kHz
   - Apply appropriate transfer functions

8. **Key Timing Parameters:**
   | Event | Labial | Alveolar | Velar |
   |-------|--------|----------|-------|
   | Area rate | 100 cm^2/s | 50 cm^2/s | 25 cm^2/s |
   | F1 transition | 10-20 ms | 10 ms + slow | ~50 ms |
   | Voicing onset | 2-5 ms | 5-15 ms | 10-15 ms |

9. **Pressure/Airflow:**
   - Intraoral pressure at release: ~6-8 cm H2O
   - Use equivalent circuit models for calculating airflow transients
