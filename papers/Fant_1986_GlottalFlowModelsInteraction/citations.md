1. **Fant, Liljencrants & Lin (1985)** - "A four-parameter model of glottal flow"
   - *Critical*: This is THE primary LF model paper. Contains full mathematical specification and parameter definitions. Essential for implementing or validating an LF source.

2. **Fant, Lin & Gobl (1985)** - "Notes on glottal flow interaction" (STL-QPSR 2-3/1985)
   - *Important*: Detailed analysis of source-filter interaction. Useful if trying to model more realistic voice source behavior beyond basic LF.

3. **Ananthapadmanabha & Fant (1982)** - "Calculation of true glottal flow and its components"
   - *Useful*: Foundation for understanding how to decompose glottal flow. Published in Speech Communication journal (more accessible than QPSR).

4. **Fant (1979)** - "Glottal source and excitation analysis"
   - *Background*: The earlier model that LF improves upon. Useful for understanding the evolution of glottal source modeling.

5. **Ananthapadmanabha (1984)** - "Acoustic analysis of voice source dynamics"
   - *Background*: Five-parameter predecessor to LF model. May contain useful analysis techniques.
