# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Homograph disambiguation is the core issue of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in Mandarin Text-to-Speech system. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm called tree-guided transformation-based learning (TTBL), which combines decision tree with transformation-based learning (TBL), is proposed to resolve homograph ambiguity. It can automatically generate templates, thereby avoiding manually summarizing templates, which is time-consuming and laborious in conventional TBL. In addition, the paper evaluates various keyword selection approaches in different domains. Results of comparative experiments show that, for the task of homograph disambiguation, templates automatically generated by decision tree achieve comparable performance to manually summarized templates, and the TTBL significantly outperforms decision tree.

## Our Interpretation

This paper addresses a key challenge in Mandarin text-to-speech: determining the correct pronunciation for characters that have multiple readings. Rather than manually engineering disambiguation rules, the authors combine decision tree learning with transformation-based error correction to automatically generate rules that progressively improve pronunciation accuracy, achieving 90.36% accuracy versus a 80.66% baseline. The work is relevant to speech synthesis because it demonstrates that automatic rule generation can match or exceed hand-crafted rules while eliminating tedious engineering, and the hybrid approach shows that rules generated from error cases are more valuable than rules from the full dataset.
