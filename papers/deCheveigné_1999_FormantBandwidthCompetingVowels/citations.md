1. **Assmann & Summerfield (1990) [1]** - Foundation for concurrent vowel research; provides the "normal bandwidth" values used in this experiment. Essential for understanding baseline bandwidth parameters.

2. **Klatt (1982) [7]** - Directly relevant to Klatt synthesis; discusses perceived phonetic distance from critical-band spectra, connecting perceptual and synthesis domains.

3. **Hirahara & Kato (1992) [6]** - Source of the Japanese vowel formant frequencies used in the experiment. Useful reference data for vowel synthesis.

4. **Rosner & Pickering (1994) [8]** - Comprehensive vowel perception/production text; useful for understanding why bandwidth has little effect on isolated vowels.

5. **de Cheveigné et al. (1997) [2]** - Detailed methods for concurrent vowel experiments; useful if implementing auditory scene analysis or multi-talker synthesis testing.
