Peterson and Barney (1952) established canonical formant frequency measurements for ten American English vowels by analyzing spectrograms from 76 speakers spanning men, women, and children. Their work documented F1, F2, and F3 frequencies for each vowel class and measured perceptual vowel recognition rates across listeners, revealing that corner vowels like [i] and [æ] were better recognized than central vowels. This dataset remains the foundational reference for vowel synthesis targets in formant-based speech synthesizers, providing the empirical targets that Klatt-style synthesizers use to generate intelligible vowel sounds across different speaker categories.
