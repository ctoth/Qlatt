The paper presents a cross-language acoustic study of /l/ allophones (clear vs. dark variants) across 23 languages and dialects, measuring formant frequencies in different phonetic contexts. Recasens quantifies the spectral differences between clear and dark /l/ (primarily via F2 frequency at ~1300-1400 Hz threshold), establishes position-dependent variation patterns (initial vs. final /l/ can differ by 200-600 Hz), and documents how vowel context affects lateral formants. These findings provide concrete F2 target frequencies for implementing phonetically accurate /l/ synthesis in text-to-speech systems, particularly the critical insight that final /l/ must be substantially darkened from initial /l/ in languages like American English.
