This paper presents a complete letter-to-sound and stress placement system for converting unrestricted English text to phonemes using ordered phonological rules with suffix and prefix classification. The system uses a three-stage architecture with cyclic stress rules, achieving 67-72% accuracy on the Brown Corpus and demonstrating how morphological decomposition can handle unknown words through rule-based phonological conversion. This work is foundational for text-to-speech systems, providing a systematic approach to grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, stress assignment, and vowel reduction that influences modern TTS design.
