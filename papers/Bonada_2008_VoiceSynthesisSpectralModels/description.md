This dissertation presents a comprehensive framework for high-quality singing voice synthesis combining spectral voice models (source-filter decomposition with harmonic analysis) and performance sampling (concatenative synthesis with intelligent trajectory generation). The research introduces multiple novel algorithms including MFPA for detecting glottal closure instants with 89% accuracy, EpR spectral decomposition separating source and vocal tract components, and phase prediction from amplitude envelopes, with validation through perceptual tests showing near-human naturalness. The work is highly relevant to Klatt synthesis, using identical Klatt-based second-order resonator filters, applying the 19dB-to-pi phase relationship, and demonstrating how careful phase management and shape invariance at glottal closure improve perceived naturalness over parametric-only approaches.
