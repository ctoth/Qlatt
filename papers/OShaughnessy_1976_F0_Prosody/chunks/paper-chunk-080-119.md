## Key Findings

### Semantic Highlighting via F0

Intonation has 2 primary functions (page 81):
1. To delimit or segment an utterance hierarchically into syntactic sections via "junctures"
2. To signal the integration of the theme and rheme in the utterance

The "center of intonation" (CI) or "main stress" is normally placed at the end of the utterance (basic CD distribution). If located elsewhere, the rheme is "emphasized for contrast."

**Key insight for TTS**: The amount of F0 accent a word receives correlates with the degree of **unpredictability** of that word in context (page 83). Words that are more predictable from context receive less F0 highlighting.

### Syntactic Grouping

F0 and intonation delimit utterances into phrasal units (page 83):
- F0 breaks up utterance into smaller, organized portions
- A rise is associated with phrase initiation
- A fall marks phrase close
- Final fall in utterance falls to a value **lower** than other falls

A major syntactic unit with two or more accented words forms a **P-unit** (prosodic unit), marked by:
- Sharp initial rise
- Final fall
- F0 remaining high medially (page 86)

### Continuation Rises (CRs)

Non-final falls are often accompanied by "continuation rises" (CRs) - a positive upturn in F0 on the last syllable of a syntactic unit, following a steep fall (page 86).

**Implementation rule**: The size of CR is proportional to:
1. How major the syntactic boundary is
2. How important the ensuing words are to the utterance message

Major breaks and breaks preceding important information have bigger CRs.

### Global F0 Patterns (Tune A - Statements)

The "archetypal normal breath-group" or F0 'carrier' pattern (page 87):
- F0 rises rapidly to a peak at the beginning of a breath-group
- Falls off gradually in the body of the utterance
- Sharp F0 drop at the end of the utterance

This "breath-group," "intonation group," or "sense group" pattern delimits unemphatic, declarative sentences in normal speech.

### Anticipation and Competition Effects

Two global phonetic F0 phenomena (page 87):
1. **Anticipation**: Speaker uses wider F0 range in longer utterances than shorter ones; raises initial F0 values to allow wider "operating range"
2. **Competition/Conservation of accent**: In utterances of the same length, the more ASs (accented syllables) there are, the less F0 obtrusion each gets

### Reference/Declination Lines

F0 is judged relative to **declination lines** - reference lines superimposed on the F0 contour (page 88):
- **Upper declination line**: formed by successive F0 peaks
- **Lower declination line**: formed by successive valleys
- Peaks above the upper line = more accent than normal
- Peaks below = less accent

The lines are:
- Somewhere between straight and exponentially concave-upward
- Always converging and monotonically decreasing
- The "envelope" shrinks with time

### Bottom of Ordinary Range (BOR)

The BOR is a range of F0 immediately around the lower declination line (page 89):
- At most 20-30 Hz wide (for male speakers)
- Averaged in the range 85-110 Hz
- F0 usually falls at a roughly exponential rate after an accent peak
- Used for unemphatic monotonic speech, stressless tails, parenthetical stretches
- F0 only goes below BOR at the end of a Tune A contour or in rare "extra-low creaky-voice tone"

### Local Phonetic Patterns - Voiced/Unvoiced Effects

**Separation of accents** (page 90): The amount of F0 obtrusion an AS receives is affected by nearby ASs. Well-separated ASs tend to have larger F0 accents than those closer together.

**Vowel height effect on F0** (pages 90-91):
- Higher vowels have higher F0: 160 Hz for /aU/ to 183 Hz for /i/ (23 Hz range)
- F0 undergoes larger accent rises with high vowels than low vowels

**Consonant voicing effect on F0** (pages 91-92):
- ASs starting with **voiced consonants/vowels** ("voiced syllables"): little prior F0 jump, mostly F0 rise during the vowel
- ASs with **unvoiced initial consonants** ("unvoiced syllables"): F0 jump up during voiceless section, little/no rise during vowel
- After a voiced consonant: F0 continues rising to a peak in the vowel before falling
- After an unvoiced consonant: F0 starts at a higher level and usually falls immediately

**Voicing between accents** (page 92):
- When intervening consonants are all voiced: F0 dropped little (at most 10-15 Hz) before the unaccented vowel
- When some consonants were unvoiced: a large F0 drop often occurred between accented and unaccented vowels, taking F0 down close to BOR rapidly

### Hierarchical F0 Analysis

The F0 contour is a composite of hierarchical patterns (page 92):
1. **Sentential level**: Overall F0 pattern on the utterance as a whole (Tune A rises rapidly on first AS, gradually falls to low level at end)
2. **Phrase level**: F0 rises to initiate syntactic phrases and falls to close them; non-final phrases marked with CRs
3. **Word level**: Accent variations due to certain words being accented (upward F0 obtrusion above the generally-falling pattern)
4. **Phonemic level**: Local F0 perturbations caused by consonants (unvoiced consonants interrupt voicing; voiced obstruents/liquids lead to dips in F0)

### Sub-contours (SCs)

Each utterance-contour consists of one or more successive **sub-contours** (SCs), superimposed on a gradually-declining F0 carrier (page 94):
- Each SC begins on an AS, with the rise in F0 lending it "prominence" or accent
- SC pattern: F0 rises to a peak on the AS, rounds off, falls on next US, continues falling on later USs at a decreasing rate (exponential shape)
- F0 eventually bottoms out at the lower "declination line"

**SC variations from archetypal rise-fall-flat pattern** (page 95):
- If AS starts with unvoiced consonant: initial rise is often "omitted" (occurs in unvoiced section)
- What remains is a short, relatively flat F0 section, followed by exponential (concave-upward) fall to the BOR

### Three Major SC Variations

1. **Double rises** (page 96): F0 rose in a continuous movement over two syllables (accenting both), usually in auxiliary-verb phrases

2. **Secondary accent** (page 97): F0 was retained at intermediate level with considerably less fall on one syllable after the main AS, giving "secondarily-important" words "half an accent"

3. **P-unit pattern** (page 97): F0 retained at a high level with very-slowly-falling F0 over a number of USs in a syntactic unit, before a rapid F0 fall-off on the last AS. This rise+relatively-level+fall pattern denotes a "phonological unit" or "P-unit" and appears restricted to coherent syntactic phrases (NP, PP, or VP)

### Accent Parameters

A measure of accent should quantify the "deviation" from the "normal" F0 falling pattern (page 97). The chosen parameters of accent in a given upward obtrusion were:
- The amount F0 rises
- The steepness of the rise
- The peak value attained

For falling accents:
- Steep falls mark accent only if occupying just one syllable's duration
- Slight falls mark secondary accent only if adjacent syllables with falling F0 have steeper, more extensive falls

**Third parameter**: The amount of prior descent (the F0 drop after a syllable's vowel tends to enhance the deviation or prominence of that syllable) (page 98)

### Statistical Analysis Results

**Rise accents** (page 99):
- "Instead" received accent in the form of a jump between nuclei of its 2 syllables: averaged +17.3 Hz (SD 4.1)
- Bisyllabic X accented on second syllable: +16.1 Hz (SD 5.1)
- Monosyllabic X with voiced start: +4.5 Hz (5.1 SD)
- Monosyllabic X with unvoiced start: +1.1 Hz (1.7 SD)

**Phonetic effect of consonant voicing**: led to about +3.5 Hz more accent following unvoiced than voiced consonants

**Fo descents** (page 100):
- Monosyllabic X: averaging -26.0 Hz
- Bisyllabic X accented on second syllable: -29.6 Hz
- Bisyllabic X accented on first: -20.7 Hz
- Voicing made a difference: 5.8 more descent from unvoiced than voiced peak
- SDs ranged from 3.6 to 7.7 Hz

**Summary** (page 102): SDs were large enough to eliminate any possibility of quantum levels of accent. Accent is clearly a continuous phenomenon. The borderline between ASs and USs is vague.

### Content-Function Word Distinction

Words conveying the most information to the listener tend to have the largest accents (page 103).

**Function words** (closed classes, non-lexical): articles, prepositions, personal pronouns, possessive adjectives, relative pronouns, common conjunctions, "one" as noun substitute, auxiliary verbs ("aux's"), reflexive pronouns, monosyllabic adverbs of degree
- Tendency toward lesser accents

**Content words** (open classes, lexical): nouns, most verbs, adjectives, adverbs, demonstratives, interrogatives, interjections, indefinite pronouns
- Provide inherently "new" information
- Receive bigger accents

For synthesis purposes, assign (page 104):
- "no stress" to function words
- "weak stress" to intermediate words
- "primary stress" to content words

Coker et al used 9 levels of stress (a continuous variable) to describe the new/old continuum (page 104):
1. new nouns
2. function words used as complements
3. repeated nouns
4. new infrequent verbs, adjectives, adverbs
5. repeated infrequent verbs
6. interrogatives, quantitatives
7. frequent verbs
8. less frequent function words
9. ordinary function words

Their system assigns a pitch target value to every phoneme and passes these values through a filter "slow enough that pitch does not quite reach the target." Target values follow the content/function distinction with higher F0 values for content words and lower for function words (a range of 100-160 Hz was used).

### Modality Operators (MOs)

MOs are the syntactically-optional words most important to the sentential message (page 105-106):
- adverbs, modal aux's, negatives, quantifiers
- They modify and delimit the "nucleus idea" or propositional content

MOs receive heavier Fo accents than other words because:
- They indicate the speaker's commitment to the truth value of the proposition
- They are inherently related to being new information
- F0 obtrusions on MOs are larger and more "resilient" (less susceptible to phonetic accent-reduction)

**Class A modals** ("might," "must," "may"): often receive accent - express part of speaker's attitude toward proposition

**Class B modals** ("can," "will," "would"): usually do not receive accent

**Aux's** (forms of "have," "be," "do"): always do not receive accent (except in cases of contrastive accent)

### Quantified Subjects

When a quantified subject was substituted for "Joe" (page 115-116):
- Peak pattern of 160-116-119 exemplified heavy relative accent on the quantifier
- Initial peak was +15 higher than with "Joe" as subject
- Peak on ensuing modal was only -9 less than on "Joe"
- Peak differential was -44 (vs. -23 for prior descent in "Joe" case)

Thus quantifiers, as MOs, received more accent than nouns in comparable utterance-initial positions.

## Rules/Algorithms

### F0 Accent Assignment Based on Word Class

1. Assign base stress level by word class:
   - Function words: no stress (level 9)
   - Intermediate words (polysyllabic prepositions, conjunctions, some pronouns, adverbs, adjectives): weak stress
   - Content words: primary stress (level 1)

2. Adjust for information content:
   - New/unpredictable words: higher F0 target
   - Repeated/predictable words: lower F0 target
   - Use 9-level scale from Coker et al

3. MO adjustment:
   - Modality operators (modals, negatives, quantifiers) get larger accents
   - Class A modals (might, must, may) often receive primary accent
   - Class B modals (can, will, would) usually not accented
   - Negatives ("not") receive heavy accent when unexpected

### Phonetic F0 Adjustments

1. **Consonant voicing adjustment**:
   - After voiced consonant: F0 continues rising to peak in vowel
   - After unvoiced consonant: F0 starts higher and falls immediately
   - Add ~3.5 Hz more accent after unvoiced consonants

2. **Vowel height adjustment**:
   - Higher vowels (e.g., /i/): add a few Hz to F0 target
   - Lower vowels (e.g., /a/): reduce F0 target slightly

3. **Separation effect**:
   - Well-separated ASs: larger F0 accents
   - Adjacent ASs: competition reduces individual accents

### Declination Model

1. Compute upper and lower declination lines:
   - Start with initial peak (first AS)
   - Lines converge and decrease monotonically
   - Shape: between straight and exponentially concave-upward

2. F0 falls exponentially after each accent peak toward the lower declination line (BOR)

3. Final fall at utterance end goes below normal BOR

### Sub-contour Generation

For each accented syllable (AS):
1. Rise to peak on the AS vowel (omit rise if AS starts with unvoiced consonant)
2. Round off at peak
3. Fall on next unaccented syllable (US)
4. Continue falling at decreasing rate on later USs (exponential shape)
5. Bottom out at lower declination line before next AS

### Continuation Rise Rule

At non-final syntactic boundaries:
1. Generate steep fall marking boundary
2. Add positive upturn (CR) on last syllable before boundary
3. CR size proportional to:
   - Boundary importance (major = bigger CR)
   - Importance of following content

> "A typical Fo contour can be viewed as the composite result of a set of hierarchical patterns (associated with sentence, phrase, word, and phoneme), with the Fo effects of each successive (more local) pattern being superimposed upon the previous higher (more global) Fo phenomenon." (page 92)

> "Accent is clearly a continuous phenomenon, with syllables ranging from heavily de-accented to heavily accented. Attempts to quantize stress into several levels (Pike, 1945) have failed in perceptual tests (Lieberman, 1965). Even the borderline between ASs and USs is vague." (page 102)

> "Words conveying the most information to the listener tend to have the largest accents." (page 103)

> "the speaker gives heavier Fo accents to the MOs in a sentence than to words in the proposition, because the former indicate the speaker's commitment to the truth value of the latter" (page 107)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody System

1. **Word class stress assignment**: Implement a lookup table categorizing words as function/intermediate/content. This determines base F0 target. Function words (articles, aux's, pronouns) get low targets; content words (nouns, main verbs, adjectives) get high targets.

2. **9-level stress continuum**: Instead of binary stressed/unstressed, use a continuous scale. Map word classes to this scale, with adjustments for:
   - Repetition in discourse (repeated = lower)
   - Predictability from syntax (predictable = lower)
   - Modality operators (higher targets, more "resilient")

3. **Declination implementation**:
   - Compute phrase duration
   - Generate upper/lower declination lines as exponentially-decaying functions
   - Upper line connects successive peaks
   - Lower line (BOR) at 85-110 Hz for male, 20-30 Hz below upper line

4. **Phonetic adjustments layer**:
   - Check initial consonant voicing: +3.5 Hz for unvoiced
   - Check vowel height: use ~23 Hz range from /a/ to /i/
   - Check syllable separation: reduce accent for closely-spaced ASs

5. **Sub-contour generation**:
   - For each AS: generate rise-peak-fall shape
   - Fall is exponential toward BOR
   - If unvoiced initial consonant: start peak high, fall immediately (no rise)
   - P-units: sustain high level across multiple USs before final fall

6. **Continuation rises**: At non-final phrase boundaries, add CR (upturn) sized proportionally to boundary strength.

7. **Anticipation effect**: For longer sentences, raise initial F0 values to provide wider operating range. More syllables = higher start.

8. **Competition effect**: Normalize total accent "budget" across ASs in a phrase. More ASs = less accent per AS.
