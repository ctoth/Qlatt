This paper presents a comprehensive acoustic analysis of English fricatives, examining spectral characteristics across labiodental, dental, alveolar, and palato-alveolar places of articulation. The study identifies spectral peak location, spectral moments, and amplitude measures as robust acoustic cues that reliably distinguish all four fricative places, achieving 77% classification accuracy using discriminant analysis. These findings provide direct acoustic parameters for fricative synthesis, including spectral peak targets (7733 Hz for /f,v/ down to 3820 Hz for /ʃ,ʒ/), amplitude levels relative to vowels (−17 to −9 dB), and duration patterns that inform formant synthesizer control.
