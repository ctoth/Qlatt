The Delta Rule Development System is a domain-specific programming language and environment for text-to-speech synthesis that uses multi-level synchronized data structures (deltas) to represent linguistic units at different levels (morphemes, letters, phonemes, syllables) in parallel. The system contributes flexible pattern-matching rules, context-dependent dictionary facilities, and an interactive symbolic debugger that allows rule writers to test and modify synthesis rules independently without the constraints of linear utterance representations. Delta's architecture is significant for speech synthesis because it enables cleaner manipulation of morphological structure, sub-phoneme units, and complex contextual rules while maintaining synchronization across linguistic levels, making it a foundational model for rule-based TTS system design.
