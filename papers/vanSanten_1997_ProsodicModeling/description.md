This paper identifies three fundamental obstacles to improving prosodic quality in text-to-speech synthesis: component-specific limitations in how synthesis architectures alter prosody, the combinatorial constraints that prevent general statistical models from generalizing to new utterances, and critical under-researched issues in timing and intonation control. Van Santen demonstrates that sums-of-products duration models with directional invariance generalize far better than CART-based approaches, and that the "concatenative assumption" underestimates spectral coarticulation effects across syllable and word boundaries. For rule-based synthesizers like Klatt, the paper establishes that comprehensive prosodic modeling is essential rather than optional, since such systems cannot rely on large speech corpora to cover combinatorial acoustic contexts.
