# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

A unified description of the most-common glottal-flow models (KLGLOTT88, Rosenberg C, R++, LF) is proposed in the time domain, using a set of five generic glottal-flow parameters: fundamental period, maximum excitation, open quotient, asymmetry coefficient, and return-phase quotient. A unified set of time-domain equations is derived, and their analytical Laplace-transform computation leads to a set of frequency-domain equations. On the basis of this mathematical framework, the spectral properties of the glottal-flow models and their derivatives are studied. It is shown that any glottal-flow model can be described by a combination of low-pass filters, the cut-off frequencies and amplitudes of which can be expressed directly in terms of time-domain parameters. The spectral correlates of time-domain glottal-flow parameters are then explored. It is shown that the maximum excitation corresponds to a gain factor, and that it controls the mid-to-high-frequency spectral slope. A non-null return-phase quotient adds an additional spectral tilt in the high-frequency part of the glottal-flow spectrum. The open quotient and asymmetry coefficient are related to the low-frequency spectral peak, also called the glottal formant. The glottal-formant frequency is mainly controlled by the open quotient, and its amplitude (or bandwidth) by the asymmetry coefficient. As a direct application, it is shown that the amplitude difference between the first two harmonics, commonly assumed to be correlated to the open quotient, is also theoretically dependent on the asymmetry coefficient.

## Our Interpretation

This paper provides a unified mathematical framework connecting time-domain glottal flow parameters (open quotient, asymmetry coefficient, etc.) to frequency-domain spectral properties across multiple glottal models. The key contribution is deriving analytical equations showing how the glottal formant frequency is controlled by open quotient while its bandwidth is controlled by asymmetry coefficient, enabling direct prediction of spectral behavior from time-domain parameters. This work is essential for speech synthesis as it explains the spectral correlates of voice quality parameters and demonstrates that the H1-H2 amplitude difference (commonly used to estimate open quotient) also depends on asymmetry coefficient.
