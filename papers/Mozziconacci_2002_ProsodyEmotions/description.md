This paper presents a methodological framework for studying emotional prosody by combining the IPO intonation model with systematic experimental design to isolate phonological (contour type) from phonetic (F0 implementation) factors in Dutch speech. The key finding is that pitch contour type and pitch implementation contribute independently to emotion perception, with contour type contributing approximately 11% and pitch implementation approximately 8% above chance baseline, demonstrating these are separate controllable dimensions. This work is critical for speech synthesis because it shows that emotional expression can be systematically engineered by independently manipulating pitch contour shape and pitch level/range, rather than treating prosody as a single monolithic parameter.
