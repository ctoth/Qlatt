This paper describes a semi-automatic "manual formant vocoder" system where a human operator marks formant positions on processed spectral displays to extract control parameters (F1-F4 frequencies and amplitudes, F0) for a four-pole parallel synthesizer. The key contribution is the detailed intelligibility evaluation showing 4.2% vowel error and 16.9% consonant error rates, with analysis revealing that manner errors (fricatives heard as stops) dominate over place and voicing errors. This early parallel synthesizer work provides rationale for the parallel formant branch architecture and introduces the phase-reversal technique for even-numbered formants to cancel inter-formant zeros, though the fixed bandwidths and binary voicing decision are simpler than modern Klatt-style synthesizers.
