This paper analyzes voice quality variations (breathy to laryngealized) across male and female speakers using acoustic analysis, introducing the KLSYN88 synthesizer and KLGLOTT88 voicing source model. The key finding is that aspiration noise is the most perceptually important cue for signaling breathiness, contrary to previous emphasis on H1 amplitude, with measurable gender differences (females average 11.9 dB H1-H2 versus males at 6.2 dB). These contributions are essential for speech synthesis as they provide a complete parameter set and perceptual validation for modeling natural voice quality variations with accurate control of spectral tilt, open quotient, aspiration, and other source characteristics.
