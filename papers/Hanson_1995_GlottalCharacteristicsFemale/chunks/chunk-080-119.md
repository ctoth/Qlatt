## Key Findings

### Chapter 4 - Physiological Measures

- **Glottal waveform parameters from oral airflow** (Fig 4.1, page 82):
  - AC flow: peak-to-peak amplitude of glottal flow
  - DC flow: minimum flow during "closed" phase
  - MFDR: Maximum Flow Declination Rate (negative peak of derivative)
  - Speed quotient = t1/t2 (rise time / fall time)
  - Open quotient = (t1+t2)/T (open time / pitch period)

- **MFDR correlates strongly with SPL** (Table 4.2, page 89):
  - Syllable strings: MFDR vs SPL r = 0.64-0.83
  - Carrier phrases: MFDR vs SPL r = 0.69-0.90
  - MFDR vs AC flow: r = 0.45-0.85
  - MFDR represents main excitation of vocal tract; amplitude of F1 is about same as SPL

- **Aerodynamic measures for female speakers** (Table 4.3, page 91):
  - SPL: 77-82 dB
  - Pressure: 5.5-10.3 cm H2O
  - DC flow: 62-130 cm³/sec
  - AC flow: 147-289 cm³/sec
  - Open quotient: 42-60%
  - Speed quotient: 1.6-3.2
  - MFDR: 191-566 l/sec²
  - F0: 178-226 Hz

- **Carrier phrase aerodynamic data** (Table 4.4, page 95):
  - SPL: 82-88 dB
  - DC flow: 62-130 cm³/sec
  - AC flow: 153-338 cm³/sec
  - Open quotient: 42-57%
  - Speed quotient: 2.3-3.2
  - MFDR: 333-676 l/sec²
  - F0: 201-262 Hz
  - B1 estimate (flow-based): 98-222 Hz

- **Group 2 speakers have higher minimum (DC) flows** than Group 1, indicating larger glottal openings during "closed" phase

- **Consonant context affects glottal parameters**: /p/ context shows more glottal abduction anticipated early in vowel production

- **Fiberscopy observations** (Section 4.5):
  - F14: tiny opening at arytenoid cartilages, abrupt closure along membranous part
  - F9: complete closure at arytenoids and along membranous part
  - F3: opening at arytenoid cartilages extending beyond vocal processes, "rolling" motion
  - F5: large opening at arytenoid cartilages extending into membranous part, gradual closing

### Chapter 5 - Voice Quality Perception Tests

- **Breathiness perception test results** (Section 5.2):
  - Group 2 speakers perceived as breathier than Group 1
  - Average breathiness rating: Group 1 = 2.2, Group 2 = 4.4 (scale 0-7)
  - Strong inter-listener agreement: r = 0.71-0.87

- **Acoustic correlates of perceived breathiness** (Table 5.1, page 108):
  - H1* - H2*: r = 0.25 (mean across listeners)
  - H1* - A1: r = 0.74 (mean) - **strongest correlate**
  - H1* - A3*: r = 0.69 (mean)
  - B1: r = 0.50 (mean)
  - Ns (noise rating): r = 0.75 (mean)

- **KLSYN88 synthesizer parameters for voice quality** (Table 5.2, page 112):
  - Open quotient (OQ): 57-70%
  - Spectral tilt (TL): 0-25 dB
  - First-formant bandwidth (B1): 60-200 Hz
  - Aspiration noise (AH): 35-48 dB
  - G1 (pressed) to G6 (breathy) parameter sets

- **Synthesis test construction** (Table 5.3, page 115):
  - For /bʌd/: OQ 60-64%, TL 8-19 dB, B1 104-256 Hz, AH 38-50 dB
  - For /bɛd/: OQ 64-65%, TL 7-22 dB, B1 53-280 Hz, AH 32-45 dB

- **Key finding**: Listeners preferred synthesized vowels matched using acoustic measures over arbitrary glottal parameter sets, validating use of H1*-A1 and other measures for guiding synthesis

## Equations Found

### Speed Quotient
$$SQ = \frac{t_1}{t_2}$$
Where:
- $t_1$ = rise time (opening phase duration)
- $t_2$ = fall time (closing phase duration)

### Open Quotient
$$OQ = \frac{t_1 + t_2}{T}$$
Where:
- $T$ = pitch period

### Relationship between AC flow, MFDR and H1*-A1
From page 98:
$$20\log_{10}(\text{AC flow}/\text{MFDR}) \propto H1^* - A1$$

This relationship shows the acoustic measure H1*-A1 can estimate glottal characteristics from the speech spectrum.

## Algorithms/Methods

### Aerodynamic Data Collection (Section 4.4.1)
1. Record oral airflow and intraoral pressure via Rothenberg mask
2. Lowpass filter airflow at 1100 Hz
3. Digitize and process signals
4. Inverse filter oral airflow to obtain glottal waveform
5. Extract parameters from four consecutive pitch periods at vowel midpoint

### Voice Quality Synthesis Test (Section 5.3)
1. Extract F0 and formant tracks from natural speech reference
2. Create test items T_i using six glottal parameter sets G_1 to G_6 (pressed to breathy)
3. Create matched test item T_M using acoustic measures (H1*-H2*, H1*-A1, etc.) to set synthesizer parameters
4. Use AXB paradigm: listeners choose which test item (A or B) is closer to reference X
5. Parameters adjusted: OQ (to match H1*-H2* and H1*-A3*), TL, B1 (to match average), AH (to match noise rating)

### Synthesizer Parameter Matching (Section 5.3.2.1)
1. Set B1 to match H1*-A1 value from acoustic analysis
2. Adjust OQ until H1*-H2* and H1*-A3* at mid-vowel are close (within 0.5 dB)
3. Adjust TL until high-frequency spectrum has appropriate harmonic/noise content
4. Set AH to match noise rating from Chapter 3

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Voice Quality Control

1. **Key parameters for breathy voice**:
   - OQ (Open Quotient): 57-70% (higher = breathier)
   - TL (Spectral Tilt): 0-25 dB (higher = breathier)
   - B1 (First Formant Bandwidth): 60-280 Hz (higher = breathier)
   - AH (Aspiration Noise): 32-50 dB (higher = breathier)

2. **Parameter correlations to acoustic measures**:
   - OQ controls H1*-H2* (increase OQ to increase H1*-H2*)
   - TL controls high-frequency rolloff
   - B1 contributes to H1 amplitude and breathiness perception
   - AH controls aspiration noise amplitude

3. **Female speaker typical ranges**:
   - F0: 178-262 Hz (higher than male ~100-150 Hz)
   - Higher formant frequencies than male
   - Group 2 (breathy) speakers have larger DC flow (incomplete closure)

4. **Acoustic-to-synthesizer mapping**:
   - Measure H1*-A1 from speech spectrum
   - Use relationship: 20log10(AC/MFDR) correlates with H1*-A1
   - Adjust B1 to achieve target H1*-A1
   - Adjust OQ to match H1*-H2* and H1*-A3*

5. **Perceptual validation**: Listeners preferred synthesized vowels matched using acoustic measures over fixed parameter sets, confirming the acoustic measures accurately reflect perceived voice quality.
