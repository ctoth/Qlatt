This paper establishes quantitative rules for predicting segment durations in English speech synthesis, analyzing how phonetic context, stress, word position, and phrase structure affect vowel and consonant timing. Klatt demonstrates that duration changes follow an incompressibility principle where segments have a minimum duration floor (approximately 42-45% of inherent duration), and a 9-parameter model accounts for 97% of variance across 56 contextual conditions. These duration rules are critical for natural speech synthesis because they control the relative timing of phonemes, with effects ranging from phrase-final lengthening (up to 2x longer) to unstressed vowel shortening (35-60% reduction), which are perceptually significant changes that exceed the just-noticeable difference threshold of approximately 25 milliseconds.
