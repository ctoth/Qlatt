This paper investigates whether listeners estimate speaker size by recovering vocal-tract length (VTL) from speech or by responding directly to formant frequencies, using synthetic vowels with systematically varied formant patterns. The key finding is that listeners rely primarily on formant frequencies themselves rather than deriving a phoneme-independent VTL estimate, with higher formants (F4, F5) improving consistency and strong phoneme-specific biases persisting even when they contradict VTL cues. For speech synthesis, this means that perceived speaker size is inherently tied to vowel identity rather than being a purely speaker-specific parameter, and that maintaining realistic F4/F5 values is important for coherent speaker characterization across phonemes.
