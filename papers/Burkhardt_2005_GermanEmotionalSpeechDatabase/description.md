This paper presents the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EmoDB), a freely available corpus of 800 acted German utterances across 7 emotions, featuring perceptual validation, narrow phonetic transcription, and electroglottogram (EGG) recordings from 10 speakers. The database demonstrates strong emotional recognition rates (79-97%) with rigorous perception filtering (>80% recognition, >60% naturalness) and includes detailed phonetic labeling with voice quality markers and syllable stress annotations. For speech synthesis, EmoDB enables extraction of emotion-specific prosodic targets (F0 contours, duration patterns, spectral tilt) and voice quality parameters from EGG data, supporting the development of emotional Klatt synthesizers with naturalistic acoustic profiles.
