This paper presents methods for synthesizing breathy and rough dysphonic voices using frequency jitter modulation and pulsatile glottal noise addition, with detailed equations and a corpus of 21 test stimuli at known parameter levels. The key contributions are a sample-by-sample phase perturbation model for frequency jitter, a pulsatile noise model modulated by glottal volume velocity (more natural than constant aspiration), and demonstration that amplitude shimmer emerges naturally from frequency perturbations through vocal tract filtering. For speech synthesis, pulsatile noise provides more natural-sounding breathiness than traditional constant aspiration noise, and jitter parameters map reliably to perceptually-relevant voice qualities from mild to severe dysphonia.
