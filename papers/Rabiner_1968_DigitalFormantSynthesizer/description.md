This paper presents a digital formant synthesizer that extends terminal-analog synthesis with three key innovations: a voiced fricative excitation network using pitch-synchronous noise modulation, a voice bar generator for voiced stop closures, and automatic higher-pole correction exploiting the periodicity of sampled data systems. The synthesizer achieves 100% identification accuracy for /z/ and /ʒ/ fricatives in VCV tests and demonstrates that spectrograms match natural speech characteristics including pitch-synchronous modulation and voice bar striations. The work is directly relevant to speech synthesis-by-rule research because it establishes the serial synthesizer architecture, validates digital formant filtering approaches, and provides practical implementations for synthesizing complex sound classes like voiced fricatives and stops.
