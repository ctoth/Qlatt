This paper investigates the phonetic mechanisms behind the diachronic fronting of high back vowels /u/ and /ʊ/ in Standard Southern British English, determining whether fronting results from tongue repositioning or lip unrounding. Through four experiments combining acoustic analysis, perception testing, and physiological measurements via EMA, the authors demonstrate that SSBE /u/ fronting is caused entirely by tongue advancement while lip rounding is maintained, with young speakers showing /u/ tongue position overlapping with /i/ yet retaining full labial rounding. For speech synthesis, these findings establish that high front /u/ vowels require formant targets with F2 nearly as high as /i/ (2050-2250 Hz) while maintaining the acoustic consequences of sustained lip rounding, and highlight the importance of modeling age-related and context-dependent variation in vowel articulation.
