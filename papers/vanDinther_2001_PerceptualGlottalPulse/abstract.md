# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The perceptual relevance of changes to glottal-pulse parameters is studied. First, it is demonstrated that a distance measure based on excitation patterns can predict audibility discrimination thresholds for small changes to the R parameters of the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model. Next, by using this measure the perceptual relevance of the LF parameters is quantified. Results are presented for a number of sets of glottal-pulse parameters that were taken from literature, representing distinct voice qualities.

## Our Interpretation

This paper establishes a quantitative relationship between LF glottal model parameters and auditory perception by validating excitation pattern distance as a predictor of perceptual discrimination thresholds. The key finding is that the LF model behaves perceptually as a 1-2 parameter system rather than truly 3-dimensional, with return phase (Ra) being the most perceptually relevant parameter for controlling voice quality. This work is critical for speech synthesis because it demonstrates that voice quality control can be simplified and made more efficient by focusing computational effort on the parameters that listeners actually perceive.
