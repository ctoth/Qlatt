This paper presents a didactic MATLAB implementation of the Klatt formant synthesizer with an integrated LF glottal model, designed to teach speech synthesis by allowing interactive exploration of how synthesis parameters affect vowel characteristics. The implementation includes complete resonator and antiresonator equations, Portuguese vowel formant data, cascade and parallel signal routing, and a working GUI configuration with validated parameters for both monophonic vowels and connected speech synthesis. The work provides direct value for speech synthesis practitioners by confirming resonator coefficient formulas, providing parameter ranges and working values, and demonstrating that the Klatt cascade/parallel architecture successfully produces perceptually acceptable vowels when properly configured.
