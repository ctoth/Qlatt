This paper investigates the articulatory mechanisms of English /r/ production across 24 speakers using ultrasound tongue imaging and synchronized lip video, documenting five distinct tongue configurations (retroflex and bunched variants) and their associated lip postures. The key finding is an articulatory trading relation where bunched tongue configurations require significantly more lip protrusion than retroflex configurations to maintain acoustically equivalent /r/ formants, and /r/ is distinguished from /w/ by exolabial (protruded without compression) versus endolabial (horizontally compressed) lip postures. For speech synthesis, this research reveals that /r/ and /w/ require fundamentally different lip parameter settings, F3 must be maintained close to F2 as the primary acoustic cue, and synthesis models must account for coarticulatory effects between tongue shape and front vowel contexts.
