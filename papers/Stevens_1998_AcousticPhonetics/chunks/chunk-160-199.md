## Key Findings

### Formant Bandwidth Contributions
- **Multiple sources of loss** contribute to formant bandwidths:
  - Radiation (B_r)
  - Wall losses (B_w)
  - Viscosity (B_v)
  - Heat conduction (B_h)
  - Airflow through constrictions (B_c)
  - Glottal opening (B_g)

- **For uniform tube (15 cm, 3 cm^2 area)** - Table 3.1a:
  - F1 (592 Hz): B_r=3, B_w=8, B_v=6, B_h=3, Total=20 Hz
  - F2 (1682 Hz): B_r=24, B_w=1, B_v=10, B_h=4, Total=39 Hz
  - F3 (2804 Hz): B_r=67, B_w=0, B_v=12, B_h=5, Total=84 Hz
  - F4 (3927 Hz): B_r=131, B_w=0, B_v=15, B_h=6, Total=152 Hz

- **For Helmholtz resonator (opening 0.32 cm^2)** - Table 3.1b:
  - F1 (300 Hz): B_r=0, B_w=28, B_v=12, B_h=2, Total=42 Hz
  - F2 (1475 Hz): B_r=0, B_w=1, B_v=8, B_h=3, Total=12 Hz
  - F3 (2950 Hz): B_r=0, B_w=0, B_v=11, B_h=5, Total=16 Hz

- **Radiation dominates** at high frequencies
- **Wall losses** are more important at low frequencies
- **Viscosity and heat conduction** are proportional to S/A (surface/area ratio)

### Bandwidth vs. Frequency Relationships
- For front-cavity resonance F at frequencies 1000-4000 Hz, bandwidth contribution B_c from constriction resistance:
  - F=1000 Hz: B_c=278 Hz
  - F=2000 Hz: B_c=170 Hz
  - F=3000 Hz: B_c=114 Hz
  - F=4000 Hz: B_c=84 Hz

### Glottal Impedance Effects
- Glottal opening contributes about **120 Hz** to first-formant bandwidth during open phase for typical male voice
- Average glottal area during open phase: ~0.06 cm^2
- For breathy voicing, F1 bandwidth can be comparable to F1 frequency
- Wide glottal opening (like /h/) can cause F1 shift of **50-100 Hz upward**
- Glottal impedance has greatest effect on F1 bandwidth; effect decreases for higher formants

### Transfer Function Properties
- For 15 cm adult female vocal tract, peak-to-valley ratio is about **19 dB** (for 1180 Hz spacing, 80 Hz bandwidth)
- Peak-to-valley ratio = 2S/(piB) where S = formant spacing, B = bandwidth
- Transfer function for uniform tube: T(s) = 1/cosh(sl/c)
- Natural frequencies: F_n = (2n-1)c/(4l)

### Vowel Spectrum Calculations (Figure 3.32)
- /a/ vowel: F1=600 Hz, F2=1200 Hz, F3=2500 Hz, SPL=85 dB
- /i/ vowel: F1=300 Hz, F2=2200 Hz, F3=2800 Hz, SPL=84 dB
- /u/ vowel: F1=300 Hz, F2=1000 Hz, F3=2500 Hz, SPL=84 dB

### Aspiration Noise
- Aspiration noise (turbulence near glottis) has greatest effect at **low frequencies** (F1, F2 range)
- Cross-sectional area during aspiration: ~0.2 cm^2
- Glottal resistance R_g approximately contributes **21 acoustic ohms** for typical airflow (750 cm^3/s)
- Source spectrum scaled down by **8 dB** to account for airflow through constriction
- Aspiration noise shows **no peak at F1**, attenuated F2 peak due to glottal resistance

### Turbulence Noise Sources
- For fricatives, noise source primarily at **obstacle/surface** in front of constriction
- Monopole noise source (volume fluctuations) dominant at **low frequencies** (below ~1.5 kHz)
- Dipole noise source dominant at **mid and high frequencies**
- Front-cavity transfer function for noise source: U_o/p_s = (A_t sin(kl_s))/(pc cos(kl_t))
- -10 dB correction applied to source spectrum for distributed source downstream from constriction

### Stop Consonant Transients
- At release, cross-sectional area increases at rate ~100 cm^2/s
- Initial transient excites front cavity, peak around **3 kHz** for front-cavity length 2.5 cm
- For short constriction (F1 movement in ~3 ms), F1 bandwidth ~400 Hz
- Transient also excites back cavity; energy oscillates at back-cavity natural frequencies

### Click Consonants
- Model: 6 cm closed cavity with negative pressure P_o
- Spectrum shows peak at front-cavity resonance (~1400 Hz for 6 cm)
- Bandwidths narrow (50-150 Hz) due to minimal losses at glottis/constriction
- Click amplitude greater than corresponding vowel peaks (as shown in Traill 1994)

### Nasal Coupling Effects
- Nasal tract: **velopharyngeal opening** connects oral and nasal cavities
- Nasal tract splits into two roughly symmetrical passages ending at nostrils
- Sinuses introduce additional pole-zero pairs in transfer function
- Lowest sinus resonances: ~450-650 Hz range
- Additional pole-zero pairs at ~400 Hz and ~1300 Hz

### Nasal Vowels
- For nasal coupling area 0.1-0.2 cm^2:
  - Additional pole-zero pair (F_n and f_z) appears at ~700 Hz
  - Pole-zero separation ~45 Hz for lowest resonance
  - Expected bandwidth perturbations ~100 Hz
- Nasal pole at ~250 Hz, zero at ~750 Hz for mouth closure (nasal consonant)
- Lowest natural frequency of nasal tract pole: ~250-300 Hz

### Lateral and Retroflex Consonants
- Side branch formed by tongue blade creates bifurcation in acoustic path
- Side branch introduces zeros at frequencies c/(4l_s) where l_s is side branch length
- For lateral/retroflex, total length l_1 + l_2 = 8-15 cm
- Most significant acoustic effects in **1200-2200 Hz range** (F2-F3 region)

### Subglottal Coupling
- Three lowest subglottal poles: ~600, 1550, 2200 Hz (adult male)
- Bandwidths: 200-400 Hz range
- Subglottal coupling occurs during open phase of glottal cycle
- Effect: +/- 3 dB perturbations near subglottal resonances
- Greatest effect on F1 (near 600 Hz subglottal resonance)

### Sound Radiation from Mouth
- Mouth opening modeled as small piston (area ~4 cm^2)
- Head approximated as sphere (radius ~9 cm for adult)
- Below ~300 Hz: radiation same as simple source (monopole)
- Above ~300 Hz: directional effects increase gradually
- At 2 kHz: ~5 dB increase on axis vs. simple source assumption
- Radiated pressure: p_r = (j*omega*rho*U_o)/(4*pi*r) * e^(-jkr)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Formant Bandwidth Calculation**
   - Total bandwidth = sum of all loss contributions
   - At F1 (~500 Hz): expect ~20-50 Hz total bandwidth
   - At F2 (~1500 Hz): expect ~40-80 Hz
   - At F3 (~2500 Hz): expect ~80-150 Hz
   - At F4 (~3500 Hz): expect ~150+ Hz
   - Bandwidth should increase with frequency (radiation dominates)

2. **Glottal Opening Effects**
   - During voicing: add ~120 Hz to F1 bandwidth during open phase
   - For aspiration (/h/): much larger bandwidth contribution
   - Glottal opening can shift F1 upward by 50-100 Hz

3. **Aspiration Noise Modeling**
   - Source is distributed over region above glottis
   - Spectrum shows NO peak at F1, attenuated F2 peak
   - Apply -8 to -10 dB correction for airflow through constriction
   - Bandwidths approximately 300, 250, 300 Hz for F1, F2, F3

4. **Fricative Noise Source**
   - Place noise source at obstacle/surface downstream from constriction
   - Dipole source dominates at mid/high frequencies
   - Monopole contribution at low frequencies (< 1.5 kHz)
   - Front-cavity resonance determines spectral peak location

5. **Stop Burst Transient**
   - Initial response: broad peak at front-cavity resonance
   - Later response: excitation of back-cavity resonances
   - Cross-sectional area increase rate: ~100 cm^2/s
   - Transient duration comparable to 1/(bandwidth)

6. **Nasal Coupling**
   - Introduces pole-zero pairs into transfer function
   - Lowest pole around 250-300 Hz
   - Zero around 1100 Hz for nasal consonants
   - For nasal vowels with small coupling: pole-zero pair around 700 Hz
   - Increases bandwidth at low frequencies

7. **Subglottal Coupling**
   - Poles at ~600, 1550, 2200 Hz
   - Creates +/- 3 dB perturbations
   - Only active during open glottal phase
   - Greatest effect on F1

8. **Transfer Function Poles**
   - For uniform tube: poles at (2n-1)c/(4l)
   - For 17.7 cm male vocal tract: ~500, 1500, 2500, 3500 Hz
   - Peak-to-valley ratio approximately 2S/(pi*B)

9. **Source-Filter Interaction**
   - Volume velocity source at glottis excites all modes maximally
   - Sound pressure source (turbulence) has position-dependent excitation
   - Source at closed end: maximum excitation of odd modes
   - Source at open end: reduced excitation

10. **Radiation Characteristic**
    - +6 dB/octave (proportional to omega)
    - Directional effects above ~300 Hz
    - At 2 kHz: ~5 dB boost on axis vs omnidirectional assumption
