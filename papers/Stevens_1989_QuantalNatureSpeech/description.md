This paper presents the quantal theory of speech, proposing that the human vocal tract and auditory system exhibit non-linear articulatory-acoustic relationships that create stable "plateau" regions separated by rapid transition zones. Stevens demonstrates how specific phonetic features (vowel height, backness, rounding, nasality, consonant place and manner) correspond to these naturally stable acoustic configurations through analysis of coupled resonators, turbulence noise generation, vocal fold vibration modes, and auditory critical boundaries. For speech synthesis, this work provides principled acoustic targets based on physics rather than arbitrary parameters—formant frequencies can be selected from stability regions where small production errors don't dramatically alter the acoustic output.
