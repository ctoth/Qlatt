## Key Findings

### Fricative Classification by Constriction Location
- Fricatives are classified by **constriction location** and **voicing**
- Constriction moves from lips towards glottis: /phi, f, theta, s, sh, c, x, h/
- Voiced counterparts: /v, delta, z, zh/
- **Sibilants** (/s, sh/) have airstream directed towards an obstacle (teeth), producing strident feature

### Source-Tract Independence
- For vowels, source-tract independence holds well - glottal source is independent of tract resonances
- For fricatives, this independence is **not as well established** because:
  - Source is localized at constriction, not separated by high glottal impedance
  - Source location affects resulting timbre
  - Source is more difficult to model than vowel production

### Key Acoustic Distinctions Among Fricatives (Strevens, 1960)
- **Front fricatives** (labial, dental, palatal): lowest intensity
- **Mid fricatives**: highest intensity with significant peaks in middle frequency range
- **Back fricatives**: medium intensity with marked formant-like structure
- All distinctions are for sounds spoken by a **single speaker** - cross-speaker variation is large

### Turbulent Jet Acoustics
- Reynolds number characterizes turbulence: Re = Vd/nu
- Critical Reynolds numbers: Re_crit separates laminar from turbulent
  - For circular jets: unstable region 160 < Re < 1200
- Jet dimensions in subsonic range depend only on constriction diameter and shape
- Sound power from jet proportional to V^8 (Lighthill 1952)
- Total sound power spectrum has broad peak at Strouhal number S = fV/d = 0.15

### Three Types of Sound Sources (Lighthill)
1. **Monopole** - obeys V^4 power law
2. **Dipole** - obeys V^6 power law (two spheres pulsing in opposite phase)
3. **Quadrupole** - obeys V^8 power law

For subsonic velocities (M < 1.0), quadrupole is least efficient source.

### Whistling in Fricatives
- Human bilabial whistles: Reynolds numbers 1400-2000
- Whistle frequencies: 500-4000 Hz (controlled by tongue position)
- Whistle frequency always captured by second or third formant of vocal tract
- Whistles can occur when jet strikes edge of cavity or obstacle

## Equations Found (LaTeX)

### Reynolds Number
$$
Re = \frac{Vd}{\nu}
$$
Where: V = representative flow velocity, d = representative dimension (constriction diameter), nu = kinematic viscosity (0.15 cm^2/sec for air)

### Strouhal Number
$$
S = \frac{fV}{d}
$$
Where: f = frequency, V = flow velocity in center of jet, d = jet diameter. Peak of sound power spectrum at S = 0.15.

### Frequency Bin Width (FFT Analysis)
$$
f_0 = \frac{f_{max}}{256} = \frac{f_c}{2 \cdot 256} = \frac{1}{1024h} = \frac{1}{T}
$$
Where: f_max = 10240 Hz, f_c = cutoff frequency, h = sample spacing, T = time record duration

### Average Power Spectrum
$$
P_X(k) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} G_{XX}(k,m), \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots N/4
$$
Where: G_XX(k,m) = X(k,m) * X*(k,m) (power spectral density)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Vowel sounds are periodic and tend to have energy concentrated in the low-frequency regions (from roughly 50 to 5000 Hz). Contrasting with vowels is the class of consonants known as fricatives, which are noisy rather than periodic, and tend to have the energy concentrated at higher frequencies (roughly 3000 to 10000 Hz)." (p. 17)

> "For fricative consonants the acoustic mechanism is not as well understood. A fricative is produced when the vocal tract is constricted somewhere along its length enough to produce a noisy sound when air is forced through the constriction." (p. 17)

> "The pressure source used in fricative models to date does not derive from specific knowledge of the sound generation process, and therefore we do not know how to alter it for a different shape of constriction, or a higher flowrate. We do not know if it interacts with the tract." (p. 24)

> "The discrepancies among the spectra of a given fricative as spoken by different speakers in different contexts are so great as to make the procedure of plotting these spectra on one set of axes a not very illuminating one." (p. 25, quoting Strevens 1960)

## Implementation Notes

### For Fricative Synthesis
1. **Source location matters:** Unlike vowels where source (glottis) is separated from tract, fricative source is at the constriction itself - this affects how the tract filters the noise

2. **Obstacle presence critical for sibilants:** /s/ and /sh/ require airstream directed at teeth (obstacle). Source function for obstacle case differs from no-obstacle case

3. **Key parameters for fricative source:**
   - Constriction area (A_c)
   - Constriction length (l_c)
   - Front cavity length (l_f) - distance from constriction to lips/teeth
   - Obstacle distance (l_o) - for sibilants
   - Flow velocity/flowrate (U)

4. **Two source types identified:**
   - "Channel turbulence" - jet emerging from constriction without obstacle
   - "Wake turbulence" - jet impinging on obstacle (teeth)
   - These produce different spectral characteristics

5. **Spectral characteristics by fricative class:**
   - Front fricatives (/phi, f, theta/): lowest intensity, smoothest spectra
   - Mid fricatives (/s, sh/): highest intensity, peaks in mid-frequency range
   - Back fricatives (/c, x/): medium intensity, formant-like structure

6. **Reynolds number determines flow regime:**
   - Re < 160: laminar (no sound)
   - 160 < Re < 1200: unstable/transitional (whistles possible)
   - Re > 1200: fully turbulent (fricative noise)

7. **Flowrate to velocity conversion:** For constriction area A_c = 0.079 cm^2 at 300-500 cc/sec, Mach number is 0.02-0.25 - well within subsonic regime where Lighthill's acoustic theory applies
