## Key Findings

### Continuation Rises (CRs) - Section 6.3

CRs signal that more utterance is to come, contrasting with terminal F0 falls at utterance end.

**Two types of CR identified:**
1. **Fall+Rise (FR) CR**: More frequent, follows a Tune A fall pattern
2. **Monotonic CR**: No prior fall, starts from high F0 level; used in limited contexts:
   - Lists with redundant information
   - Lists of single words
   - Phrases within scope of quantifier like "both"

**CR size depends on:**
- Strength of syntactic boundary (major boundaries = larger CRs)
- Length of phrases involved (longer phrases = larger CRs)
- Amount of important information following the break

### Quantitative CR Parameters (page 283)

| Context | CR Size (Hz) | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Inter-clause (set G average) | +10 | From F0 value of 104 Hz, after -37 Hz fall-off |
| Non-parallel clauses | +15 | Different sizes/structures |
| Parallel clauses (end of 1st of 2) | +29 | |
| Parallel clauses (end of 1st of 3) | +38 | |
| Comma locations (3-word phrases) | +12 | |
| Subject-verb boundary (2+ AS subjects) | +14 | Long subject in first of 2 clauses |
| Subject-verb boundary (3+ AS subjects) | +8 | |
| 2-AS subjects in single-clause | +7 | Independent of utterance size |
| 2 conjoined NPs (3+ content words, final) | +13 | |
| Non-comma NP-VP boundary | +4 | Small, optional |

### Tunes I and II (Armstrong & Ward 1926)

- **Tune I**: Fall pattern - used for "conclusive intonation" (finality)
- **Tune II**: Rise pattern - used for "not so definite" statements, inconclusive intonation
  - NOT the typical yes/no question rise (which starts higher and goes higher)
  - Signals "more to come" or "something implied but not stated"

**Punctuation correlations:**
- CRs (Tune II) often related to commas, dashes, parentheses
- Tune I falls tend to occur with periods and semi-colons

### Offset Transformations - Section 6.4

**Fronting transformations** (move constituent to sentence start):
1. **Topicalization**: Moves phrase to initial position ("The carrot a farmer was eating")
2. **Left dislocation**: Moves phrase to initial position, leaves pronoun trace ("The carrot, a farmer was eating it")

**Backing transformations** (move constituent to sentence end):
1. **Right dislocation**: Moves phrase to end, leaves pronoun copy ("He was eating the carrot, the farmer")
2. **Extraposition**: Moves sentential subject to end ("It is true that fish is tasty")

**F0 effects of offset transformations:**
- Left-offsetting creates clear F0 break at end of fronted phrase
- Fronted constituents form separate syntactic units marked by sharp F0 falls
- Right-offset phrases treated as "afterthought" with F0 below BOR (baseline of reference)
- Dislocation more pronounced than topicalization (sharper F0 movements)

### Quantitative Offset F0 Data (pages 297-301)

| Transformation | F0 Descent at Boundary | CR at Boundary | Notes |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|-------|
| Left dislocation ("flounder") | -19 to -29 | +9 to +24 | Larger than topicalization |
| Topicalization | Small increase | +4 | Moderate focus effect |
| Right dislocation | -65 ("cook it") | None | Falls below BOR |
| Right dislocation | -51 ("carefully") | None | Treated as "afterthought" |
| Extraposition | -4 (matrix-embedded) | +2 (small) | De-emphasizes moved subject |

### Ellipsis/Deletion Effects - Section 6.5

**Gapping** (deletion from middle of clause):
- Local F0 effects primarily
- Word preceding gap often receives increased accent
- Signals syntactic boundary at gap location

**Key finding**: Upon deletion of relatively-unaccented words, phonetic effects of **competition**, **separation**, and **anticipation** caused smaller accents and smaller F0 breaks on remaining words.

**Ellipsis site marking:**
- Words preceding ellipsis sites tend to receive increased accents (even if normally unaccented)
- This marks the gap location for the listener
- Helps signal that words have been removed

### Noun-phrase Structuring Patterns - Section 6.6

NPs with more than one content word show F0 structuring:
- First content word: biggest accent (large F0 rise, highest peak in NP)
- Last content word: falling F0, ending at lowest level in NP
- Intermediate words: occupy medial F0 levels between first and last

**Peak differentials within NPs:**
- Closely-related word pairs: average -19 Hz differential
- Other pairs: average only -9 Hz differential
- Compounds (e.g., "polar bears"): biggest differentials (averaging -37 Hz)
- Differentials crossing parenthesis boundaries: -11 to +7 Hz (averaging -1)
- Differentials not crossing parentheses: average -24 Hz

### Declination Lines - Section 7.1.1

**General declining trend** observed for both peaks and valleys as utterance progresses:
- Highest peak was the first
- Lowest valley was the last
- This creates a "carrier" where later accented syllables have lower peaks and smaller accents

**Quantitative declination data (Table 149, page 319-320):**

| Number of Sub-contours | Peak Pattern (Hz) | Average Drop-off per Peak |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 2 SCs | 174 - 136 | -38 Hz |
| 3 SCs | 179 - 150 - 132 | -24 Hz |
| 4 SCs | 190 - 161 - 167 - 140 | -17 Hz |
| 5 SCs | 184 - 154 - 171 - 159 - 143 | -10 Hz |

**Anticipation effect**: Initial F0 peak increased with number of SCs in utterance, up to ~190 Hz limit. Utterances with 4+ SCs had highest initial peaks.

**Middle ground phenomenon**: In longer utterances (4+ SCs), middle peaks occupy a "middle ground" with little drop-off between them.

**Valley behavior**: Final valley averaged 85 Hz; preceding valleys showed declining trend toward this final low value.

## Rules/Algorithms

### CR Placement Algorithm

1. **At clause boundaries**: Place CR at end of non-final clauses
   - If final clause: F0 falls below BOR (no CR)
   - If non-final clause: F0 falls, then rises in CR pattern

2. **CR size calculation**:
   - Base size depends on boundary strength
   - Major syntactic breaks (parallel clauses, embedded clauses) = larger CRs (+29 to +38 Hz)
   - Minor breaks (NP-VP, comma) = smaller CRs (+4 to +12 Hz)
   - Longer following material = larger CR

3. **Intra-clause CR placement**:
   - No CRs in clauses with only 2 content words
   - 1 CR in clauses with 3-4 content words (26-80% probability)
   - Multiple CRs in clauses with 5+ content words (almost invariable)
   - Place at "strongest" syntactic boundary within clause

### Monotonic vs FR CR Selection

```
IF quantifier "both" precedes conjoined phrases:
    USE monotonic CR (rising from high level, no prior fall)
ELSE IF list contains redundant information:
    USE monotonic CR
ELSE IF gnomic expression (e.g., "Easy come, easy go"):
    USE monotonic CR
ELSE:
    USE FR CR (fall followed by rise)
```

### Offset Transformation F0 Rules

**Left-offset (fronting):**
1. Sharp F0 fall at end of fronted constituent
2. CR optional but common at fronted phrase boundary
3. Fronted material forms separate P-unit

**Right-offset (backing):**
1. F0 falls below BOR before offset phrase
2. No CR heralds the offset phrase
3. Offset phrase treated as "afterthought" (reduced prominence)

### Ellipsis F0 Compensation

```
WHEN word is deleted from utterance:
    IF aux remains before deletion site:
        aux receives increased accent (marks ellipsis site)
    IF content word precedes deletion site:
        preceding word may receive rise+fall+rise pattern

    Apply competition effect:
        remaining words may increase in accent
        (deletion of competing accented words)
```

### NP F0 Structuring

```
FOR each NP with N content words (N >= 2):
    word[1].peak = highest in NP (largest rise accent)
    word[N].peak = lowest in NP (falling F0)

    FOR i = 2 to N-1:
        word[i].peak = interpolate between word[1] and word[N]

    IF word[i] and word[i+1] form syntactic unit:
        peak_differential = -19 Hz (larger drop)
    ELSE:
        peak_differential = -9 Hz (smaller drop)
```

### Declination Implementation

```
FOR utterance with K sub-contours (accent groups):
    // Set initial peak based on utterance length
    IF K >= 4:
        initial_peak = 190 Hz (maximum)
    ELSE:
        initial_peak = 157 + (K-1) * 11 Hz  // approximate

    // Calculate per-peak drop-off
    drop_off_per_peak = {2: -38, 3: -24, 4: -17, 5: -10}[K]

    // Apply declination
    FOR i = 1 to K:
        IF i == 1:
            peak[i] = initial_peak
        ELSE IF i == K:
            peak[i] = ~138 Hz (final peak target)
        ELSE:
            // Middle peaks: smaller drop-offs
            peak[i] = peak[i-1] + drop_off_per_peak * attenuation_factor

    // Valleys follow similar declining pattern
    final_valley = 85 Hz
    // Earlier valleys interpolate toward final
```

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "A CR is often used in the latter portion of the last syllable of a non-final syntactic phrase to signal to the listener that that particular phrase is over but that more utterance is yet to come." (page 294)

> "The size of the CR appears dependent upon the 'strength' of the boundary (major syntactic breaks have larger CRs), upon the lengths of the phrases involved (longer phrases have larger CRs), and upon the amount of new and important information following after the break (the more important information ensuing, the larger the CR)." (page 283)

> "There are 2 types of CR: the more frequent fall+rise CR, which contrasts with a Tune A fall, and a monotonic CR, which has no prior fall." (page 294)

> "The major Fo effect of the offset transformations and phrases was that the offset constituents formed separate syntactic units, which were heavily marked in Fo through the use of sharp Fo falls, marking the end of a fronted unit in one case and the end of the main portion of the utterance before a backed unit in the other case." (page 301)

> "The deletion or 'ellipsis' of old words from a sentence led to mostly local Fo effects. Upon deletion of relatively-unaccented words, the phonetic effects of competition, separation, and anticipation caused smaller accents and smaller Fo breaks on the remaining words." (page 315-316)

> "Of major note in Table 149 is the general declining trend for both peaks and valleys as the utterance progressed. In particular, the highest peak in each case was the first, and the lowest was the last." (page 319)

> "The implications of these findings for an Fo-by-rule algorithm is that, in addition to specifying how big an accent each content word might have (based upon other syntactic/semantic phenomena), one must have (at least in non-coordinated NPs of 3 or more content words), a simple bracketing pattern to indicate how much the Fo peak on a given word should drop." (page 318)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody System

1. **CR Implementation**:
   - Track clause boundaries and phrase lengths
   - At non-final clause ends: implement fall-rise pattern
   - CR magnitude scales with boundary strength (+10 to +38 Hz range)
   - Use monotonic rise for lists/quantifier scope

2. **Declination**:
   - Count accent groups (sub-contours) in utterance
   - Set initial peak based on utterance length (up to 190 Hz)
   - Apply per-peak drop-off that decreases with more SCs
   - Final valley targets ~85 Hz

3. **Offset/Parenthetical Handling**:
   - Fronted phrases: treat as separate P-unit with sharp fall at boundary
   - Right-dislocated phrases: drop F0 below BOR, treat as afterthought
   - Parentheticals: reduced prominence, bounded by F0 breaks

4. **Information Structure**:
   - New information gets larger accents
   - Redundant/repeated words get reduced accents
   - Contrasting elements in parallel structures get emphasis
   - First element in parallel construct gets more accent than second

5. **NP Internal Structure**:
   - First content word: peak of NP
   - Last content word: trough
   - Intermediate words: gradual interpolation
   - Compound words: larger internal drop (-37 Hz vs -9 Hz)
