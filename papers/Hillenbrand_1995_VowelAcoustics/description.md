This paper provides updated measurements of formant frequencies (F0-F4), durations, and spectral properties for 12 American English vowels recorded from 139 speakers (men, women, and children), replicating and extending the classic Peterson & Barney (1952) study with modern digital recording and LPC analysis techniques. Key findings show that vowels require spectral change over time for accurate identification (achieving 94.1% classification accuracy with 20% and 80% duration samples combined), that tense vowels are significantly longer than lax vowels, and that formant values vary systematically by talker gender and age. For speech synthesis, this paper is essential for establishing accurate formant targets across speaker types and demonstrates that static steady-state formants alone are insufficient for natural vowel synthesis, requiring dynamic formant trajectories aligned with vowel duration structure.
