# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Speech synthesis with a terminal-analog synthesizer of the type developed by Dennis Klatt requires that a large number of parameters be specified to control the sources and filters. A method of control of the synthesizer using just 10 higher-level (HL) parameters is described. These parameters specify the essential aspects of the production of an utterance, including vocal-tract natural frequences, orifice sizes and other source-related attributes. A set of transformations maps the HL parameters to the Klatt parameters. The paper gives examples of the pattern of HL parameters for the synthesis of stop and nasal consonants and illustrates the use of these parameters for analysis-by-synthesis.

## Our Interpretation

This paper proposes a simplified control scheme for Klatt formant synthesizers by introducing 10 higher-level (HL) parameters that map to the complex set of 40+ lower-level Klatt (KL) parameters, incorporating physical constraints from speech production. The approach is powerful for speech synthesis because it reduces the control complexity while preserving acoustic accuracy, and it demonstrates how to derive mid-level vocal-tract and source parameters from production-oriented articulatory concepts.
