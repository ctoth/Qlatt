## Key Findings

### Thesis Overview
- Aim: Develop descriptors of voicing source reflecting individual differences in voice qualities of female speakers
- Descriptors derived from measurements of spectra of vowels
- Configuration of vocal folds and arytenoid cartilages shapes the glottal waveform
- More open glottal configuration results in:
  - Greater low-frequency and weaker high-frequency components
  - Greater aspiration noise
  - Larger bandwidths of vocal tract formants (especially F1)
- These effects are measurable directly from speech spectrum or waveform
- 22 female speakers were analyzed and classified according to hypothesized glottal configurations
- Classifications correlated with perceived voice quality

### Sources of Speaker Individuality (page 18)
1. **Sound sources** - voicing source at vocal folds, turbulence sources along vocal tract
2. **Supraglottal filtering** - oral and nasal cavity natural frequencies vary between individuals
3. **Subglottal coupling** - coupling between sub- and supraglottal cavities affects vowel spectra (varies for speakers who don't close glottis completely)
4. **Source-filter interaction** - contrary to simple source-filter theory, interaction can occur between voicing source and vocal tract filter
5. **Kinematics** - movements of articulators including vocal folds vary person to person

### Glottal Characteristics (Chapter 2)

#### Vocal Fold Anatomy (page 22-23)
- Vocal folds connect anterior end (thyroid cartilage) to posterior end (arytenoid cartilages)
- Space between folds = **glottis**
- Cross-sectional area of glottis is periodically modulated during phonation
- Folds have membranous part (anterior) attached to vocal processes

#### Vibratory Cycle (page 23)
- Lungs provide constant pressure source below folds
- During one vibration cycle:
  1. Transglottal pressure builds up until folds begin to separate at lower edge
  2. Separation propagates along vertical length until folds completely separated
  3. Folds most widely separated; pressure within glottis is small
  4. Lower edges of folds come back together
  5. Upper edges follow
  6. Cycle begins anew
- Pitch period T ranges about **100-300 Hz** for adult speakers
- Acoustic energy produced over broad frequency range up to about **5000 Hz**
- Key: folds close rapidly, resulting in abrupt cessation of airflow
- Abrupt cessation at about **4.5 ms** (from Fig 2.2b)

#### Glottal Openings (page 25)
- **Glottal chink** or **posterior chink**: opening at posterior end of folds (arytenoid cartilages)
- **Glottal gap**: opening at glottis (can occur at anterior end, center, or elsewhere)
- **Fixed opening**: opening that persists during closed phase (causes DC offset)
- Posterior openings common among female speakers (Biever and Bless, 1989; Sodersten and Lindestad, 1990; Rammage et al., 1992)
- Even trained female voices show these openings (Hammarberg 1993, Hertegard et al. 1992)
- Anatomical differences between males and females explain prevalence in females

#### DC Flow / Minimum Flow (page 25-26)
- When incomplete glottal closure: airflow bypass even during "closed" phase
- Results in **DC offset** in glottal waveform (also called **DC flow** or **minimum flow** or **residual flow**)
- Waveform at closure is smoothed compared to abrupt closure (Fig 2.2b)
- Non-abrupt closure reduces high-frequency content of derivative dUg(t)/dt

### Glottal Waveform Parameters (page 27-28, Figure 2.4)

Key parameters from KLSYN88 synthesizer (Klatt and Klatt, 1990):

| Parameter | Symbol | Definition |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Glottal waveform | Ug(t) | Volume velocity through glottis |
| Derivative | dUg/dt | Derivative of glottal waveform |
| AC flow | AC | Peak-to-peak amplitude of periodic component |
| DC flow | DC | Minimum/offset flow level |
| Peak flow | - | Maximum of Ug(t) |
| Pitch period | T | Duration of one glottal cycle |
| Rise time | t1 | Time from flow onset to peak |
| Fall time | t2 | Time from peak to closure |
| Speed quotient | SQ | t1/t2 (ratio of rise time to fall time) |
| Open quotient | OQ | (t1+t2)/T (ratio of open time to pitch period) |
| MFDR | - | Maximum flow declination rate (max negative slope of dUg/dt) |

#### Spectral Effects of Parameters
- **DC flow** and **abruptness of closure**: affect spectrum at middle and high frequencies
- **Pitch period (1/F0)**: important for intensity (SPL) and quality
- **Rise time (t1)** and **fall time (t2)**: indicated in waveform
- **MFDR**: most important parameter for SPL; reflects how rapidly folds close; represents point of greatest excitation of vocal tract
- **AC flow**: modulated by vibrating vocal folds; sum of DC and AC flows represents maximum airflow
- **Open quotient**: ratio of time vocal folds are open to pitch period
- **Speed quotient** or **skewness**: ratio of rise time to fall time (t1/t2)

### Voice Quality Correlates (page 28-29)

**Pressed voice** (laryngealization):
- Reduced open quotient
- Reduced airflow through glottis
- Characterized by reduced OQ and reduced DC flow

**Breathy voice**:
- Greater amount of air passing through glottis than modal phonation
- Large amount of air thought to be due to incomplete glottal closure or gradual closing movement
- Results in larger open quotient
- Increased DC flow
- Waveform more sinusoidal with increased DC flow
- Breathy/hypofunctional voice: low laryngeal effort, almost sinusoidal waveform
- Increased MFDR and AC flow (skewed waveform to compensate for glottal losses)

### Measurement Methods (Section 2.3)

#### Inverse Filtering (page 29-30)
- Based on source-filter theory: sound filtered linearly by vocal tract
- If formants removed from speech waveform with inverse filter, result is glottal waveform
- Can be done on acoustic sound pressure or oral airflow
- **Rothenberg mask** (Fig 2.5): measures oral airflow directly
  - Preserves zero flow level
  - Frequency response flat only up to ~1200 Hz
  - Higher frequencies lowpass filtered (abruptness of closure lost)
  - Requires tight fit (mask leak reduces measured amplitude)
- **Microphone recordings**: easier to collect mid-high frequencies
  - But inverse-filtered recordings sensitive to low-frequency noise
  - Don't preserve zero flow level (absolute transglottal airflow cannot be measured)
- Fant (1979, 1993), Fant et al. (1985, 1994), Ananthapadmanabha (1984) developed techniques for relating glottal waveform parameters to spectrum

#### Visual Observation (page 31-32)
- **Endoscope** (Fig 2.6a): rigid, inserted into oral cavity; good image quality but limited to open vowels
- **Fiberscope** (Fig 2.6b): flexible, inserted through nasal cavity; more speech material possible but lower image quality

#### Acoustic Measures (page 33)
- Measures made directly on speech spectrum or waveform
- Examples: jitter, shimmer, level of first harmonic relative to second harmonic
- H1-H2 measure correlated with degree of perceived breathiness and open quotient (Klatt and Klatt, 1990)

### Related Work (Section 2.4)

#### Holmberg et al. Studies (page 33-34)
- Extensive aerodynamic measures of male and female voice
- Parameters found significantly related to SPL:
  - For normal loudness/pitch: female speakers had lower peak flow, AC flow, and maximum flow declination rate (MFDR)
  - Females had more gradual opening or closing times, leading to less well-defined closed portions
- Several aerodynamic measures well correlated
- Strong relationship: **open quotient** (from glottal waveform) correlates with **H1-H2 amplitude difference** (first two harmonics)
- MFDR also reflected by amplitude difference of first and third formants in some cases

#### Karlsson Studies (page 34-35)
- Studied small group of female speakers using inverse filtering
- Found most female speakers have DC offset in glottal airflow (suggesting incomplete closure)
- Correlated glottal parameters with voice qualities judged by speech therapists
- Found voice quality separated by:
  - Degree of **spectral tilt** of voice source
  - Presence of **noise excitation at mid- to high frequencies**
- Breathy speakers: higher minimum flows, steeper tilts, more aspiration noise
- Tight/strained quality: weaker lower harmonics

#### Sodersten Studies (page 34-35)
- Studied glottal closure via fiberscopy
- Used acoustic measure L0-L1: level of fundamental relative to first formant
- Results show female speakers have higher degree of incomplete closure
- Significant correlations between breathiness and L0-L1 (even after voice training)
- Supports hypothesis: incomplete closure in females due to anatomy rather than behavior

#### Klatt and Klatt (1990) (page 35)
- Studied voice quality variations using synthesized speech (reiterant and synthesized)
- Found female speakers perceived to be breathier than male speakers
- Relied entirely on acoustic measures from speech spectrum and waveform
- Relevant cues for perception of breathy voice:
  - Increases in amplitude of **fundamental component**
  - **Aspiration noise**
  - Lower **formant bandwidths**
- Aspiration noise found to be most important cue to breathy voice

#### Kasuya and Ando (1991) (page 35)
- Study limited to two female subjects
- Found increased amplitude of fundamental and amount of glottal turbulence noise were important cues for perceived breathiness

### Chapter 3 Beginning: Acoustic Measures Theory

#### Complete Glottal Closure (page 38-39)
- When glottis closes completely, differences manifest at low frequencies (near lowest harmonics)
- For a given F0, no change in spectrum amplitude at high frequencies (Klatt and Klatt, 1990)
- Differences in **open quotient** can arise from lateral compression of vocal folds
- **Open quotient (OQ)** varies from 30% to 70%
- When OQ changes from 30 to 70 percent, amplitude difference between H1-H2 changes by about **10 dB**

#### Spectral Effects of OQ and TL (Figure 3.1, page 39)
- Panel (a)-(b): OQ=30%, TL=0: spectrum shows H1, H2 peaks
- Panel (c)-(d): OQ=70%, TL=0: H1-H2 difference larger
- Panel (e)-(f): OQ=70%, TL=15 dB (spectrum 15 dB lower at 3 kHz): more gradual spectral rolloff
- Generated using KLSYN88 synthesizer

#### Abrupt vs Gradual Closure (page 38)
- Spectrum of derivative has discontinuity at time of closing
- When derivative discontinuity present: downward slope of **6 dB/octave**
- This 6 dB/octave slope affected by abruptness with which flow is cut off when membranous part of vocal folds closes
- **Zipper closure**: initial closure at anterior end of glottis, closure slides back along length
- Zipper closure leads to more gradual cutoff of flow

## Equations Found

### Speed Quotient
$$SQ = \frac{t_1}{t_2}$$
where:
- $t_1$ = rise time (time from flow onset to peak)
- $t_2$ = fall time (time from peak to closure)

### Open Quotient
$$OQ = \frac{t_1 + t_2}{T}$$
where:
- $t_1$ = rise time
- $t_2$ = fall time
- $T$ = pitch period

### H1-H2 Relationship with Open Quotient
- When OQ varies from 30% to 70%, the difference between H1 and H2 amplitudes changes by approximately **10 dB**
- Higher OQ = larger H1-H2 difference (H1 more prominent)

| Abrupt closure time | - | ~4.5 | ms | Time for flow cessation (modal) |
| Open quotient range | OQ | 30-70 | % | Typical range |
| H1-H2 change per OQ range | - | ~10 | dB | Change when OQ goes 30%->70% |
| Spectral tilt (abrupt closure) | TL | 0 | dB | No additional tilt |
| Spectral tilt (breathy) | TL | 15 | dB | At 3 kHz, spectrum 15 dB lower |
| Rothenberg mask flat response | - | up to 1200 | Hz | Frequency limit for flat response |
| Spectral slope (abrupt closure) | - | 6 | dB/octave | High-frequency rolloff of dUg/dt |

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Voice Quality Modeling

1. **Female voice characteristics to model:**
   - Higher likelihood of incomplete glottal closure (DC offset/minimum flow)
   - More gradual closure leading to reduced high-frequency content
   - Larger open quotient values
   - Higher H1-H2 differences (H1 more prominent)
   - More aspiration noise (AH parameter)
   - Wider first formant bandwidth (B1)

2. **Key synthesis parameters for breathiness:**
   - Increase **OQ** (open quotient) - typical female: higher end of 30-70% range
   - Increase **TL** (spectral tilt) - up to 15 dB at 3 kHz for breathy voice
   - Increase **AH** (aspiration amplitude) - most important cue for breathiness
   - Increase **B1** (first formant bandwidth) - due to subglottal coupling with incomplete closure
   - Add **DC offset** to glottal waveform for incomplete closure simulation

3. **H1-H2 as voice quality indicator:**
   - Can measure from synthesized output to verify voice quality
   - Higher H1-H2 = more open/breathy
   - Lower H1-H2 = more pressed/tight
   - ~10 dB change across full OQ range (30-70%)

4. **Spectral tilt implementation:**
   - 6 dB/octave natural slope from abrupt closure
   - Additional tilt (TL parameter) for gradual/breathy closure
   - TL=15dB at 3kHz for notably breathy voice

5. **Gender differences summary for synthesis:**
   - Female: higher F0, higher OQ, more DC flow, more aspiration, wider B1
   - Male: lower F0, lower OQ, more abrupt closure, less aspiration, narrower B1
