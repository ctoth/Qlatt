This paper establishes 3D tongue position targets for English lingual consonants (/t, d, s, z, ʃ, ʧ, k, g/) using electromagnetic articulography across 19 speakers, measuring where the tongue achieves maximum elevation during consonant production. The study demonstrates that cognate pairs share identical positional targets (voicing does not change tongue position), but alveolar stops and fricatives occupy distinct regions despite sharing a place of articulation, with fricatives positioned more anteriorly and lower than stops. These findings are critical for formant synthesis because they show that different manner classes require different vocal tract configurations even when nominally produced at the same place of articulation, and that between-speaker variability correlates with speaking rate and palate morphology—information essential for creating natural-sounding synthesized consonants.
