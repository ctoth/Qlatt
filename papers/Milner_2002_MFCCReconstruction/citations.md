1. **Kleijn & Paliwal (1995)** - "Speech coding and synthesis" - Comprehensive textbook on speech codecs and synthesis methods. Fundamental reference for source-filter model, LPC analysis, and excitation coding schemes.

2. **McAuley & Quatiery (1986)** - Sinusoidal speech representation - Alternative to source-filter model for analysis/synthesis. Important for understanding different approaches to speech reconstruction.

3. **Chasan et al (2000)** - Direct predecessor to this paper, also reconstructs speech from MFCCs but using sinusoidal model instead of source-filter. Good comparison point.

4. **ETSI ES 201 108 (2000)** - ETSI Aurora standard for distributed speech recognition front-end. Defines the MFCC computation procedure used in this paper (and widely in ASR systems).
