# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

A new type of glottal flow model, namely a causal-anticausal linear filter model, is proposed. It is shown that the glottal flow signal can be considered as the impulse response of a linear filter. Then the source/filter speech model can be interpreted as an excitation/filter speech model, the "filter" comprising the glottal flow, vocal tract and radiation components. The spectral features of the voice source models are reviewed, both in the amplitude and phase domains. In the spectral amplitude domain the main features are a spectral maximum (the "glottal formant") and spectral tilt. Evidence for a mixed causal/anticausal phase behavior of the source is given. Then, a causal-anticausal linear filter voice source model is designed. In conclusion, applications of this new approach are discussed for voice quality modification, voice source estimation, voice quality perception.

## Our Interpretation

This paper demonstrates that glottal flow can be represented as a causal/anticausal linear filter (CALM), unifying time-domain and spectral modeling approaches that previously seemed incompatible. The key insight is that the glottal flow impulse response exhibits mixed phase behavior—anticausal poles handle the glottal formant resonance while a causal pole models spectral tilt—enabling systematic analysis and modification of voice quality parameters.
