# The Phonology and Phonetics of English Intonation

**Author:** Janet Breckenridge Pierrehumbert

**Venue:** MIT PhD Thesis, Department of Linguistics and Philosophy
**Supervisor:** Morris Halle

## One-Sentence Summary

English intonation is generated by a finite-state grammar producing structured strings of just two tones (H and L) as pitch accents, phrase accents, and boundary tones, which are mapped to F0 contours through local, left-to-right phonetic implementation rules including downstep (exponential decay) and upstep.

## Problem Addressed

Previous intonation theories used multiple tone levels (typically 4) or treated intonation as continuous pitch movements. Pierrehumbert argues these approaches cannot explain:
1. How the same intonation pattern can be produced at different pitch ranges
2. How downstepped sequences can create more than 4 distinct F0 levels
3. The compositional nature of phrase-final contours (nuclear accent + phrase accent + boundary tone)
4. The relationship between stress/prominence and F0 realization

## Key Contributions

1. **Two-tone theory**: All English intonation patterns derive from sequences of just H (High) and L (Low) tones
2. **Finite-state grammar**: Well-formed tunes can be generated by a simple state machine
3. **Three-component phrase structure**: pitch accents + phrase accent + boundary tone
4. **Baseline model**: F0 values computed in "baseline units above baseline" enabling cross-speaker comparison
5. **Downstep rule**: Exponential decay model where each H after L is scaled by factor k (~0.6)
6. **Upstep rule**: Additive raising of boundary tones after H- phrase accent
7. **Tone spreading**: T- spreads rightward when next tone is equal or higher in phonetic value
8. **Local left-to-right implementation**: No lookahead required; each tone computed from immediately preceding tone

## The Tonal Inventory

### Pitch Accents

| Accent | Description | Example Context |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **H*** | High tone on stressed syllable | Most common; declaratives |
| **L*** | Low tone on stressed syllable | Contradiction, incredulity |
| **L*+H** | Low on stress, High trailing | Scooped rising pattern |
| **L+H*** | Low leading, High on stress | Less common variant |
| **H*+L** | High on stress, Low trailing | British English pattern |
| **H+L*** | High leading, Low on stress | Downstepped pattern |
| **H*+H-** | High with trailing high phrase accent | Creates plateau |
| **H-+L*** | High phrase accent leading to Low | Downstepping family |
| **L-+H*** | Low phrase accent leading to High | Scooped accent |

### Phrase Accents

| Accent | Description | Function |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **H-** | High phrase accent | Maintains/raises F0 after nuclear accent |
| **L-** | Low phrase accent | Lowers F0 after nuclear accent |

### Boundary Tones

| Tone | Description | Typical Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **H%** | High boundary tone | Yes/no questions, continuation rise |
| **L%** | Low boundary tone | Statements, finality, wh-questions |

### Complete Valid Combinations (22 patterns)

The thesis documents 22 distinct nuclear configurations out of 28 logically possible. Six are neutralized:
- H*+L- L- L% and H*+L- L- H% → neutralized with H* L- patterns
- All H*+H- cases → neutralized with H* for either phrase accent

## Phonological Rules

### Finite-State Grammar for Tunes (Rule 14, page 29)

```
[Boundary Tone] → Pitch Accents → Phrase Accent → Boundary Tone
    (H%/L%)        (one or more)      (H-/L-)        (H%/L%)
```

### Pitch Accent Assignment (Rules 22a, 22b)

- **Rule 22a**: If a foot has a pitch accent, any foot of equal or greater metrical strength also has a pitch accent
- **Rule 22b**: There are no pitch accents after the nuclear stress of the phrase

### Downstep Rule (Rule 8)

In H+L H_i and H L+H_i contexts:
$$
/H_i/ = k \cdot /H_i/ \quad \text{where } 0 < k < 1
$$

Typical k ≈ 0.60

### Upstep Rule (Rule 9)

After H- phrase accent:
$$
/T/ = /H^-/ + /T/
$$

This raises L% to the level of H- and raises H% even higher.

### Tone Spreading Rules

**Rightward Spreading:**
$$
T^-_i \text{ spreads towards } T_{i+1} \text{ if } /T_{i+1}/ \geq /T^-_i/
$$

**Leftward Spreading:**
$$
T^-_i \text{ spreads towards } T_{i-1} \text{ if } /T_{i-1}/ = /T^-_i/
$$

### L Tone Scaling Rules

- **Rule 3**: In H+L: /L/ = k/H/ where 0 < k < 1
- **Rule 4**: In H(+T) L+: /L/ = n/H/ × Prominence(H)/Prominence(L) where 0 < n < k
- **Rule 5**: In H(+T) L-: /L-/ = p/H/ where 0 < p < k
- **Rule 6**: /L%/ = 0 (on baseline)
- **Rule 7**: L pitch accent following L* gets same value as L* nuclear accent

### Interpolation Rules

- **Between two H*s**: Nonmonotonic (dipping) - F0 falls then rises
- **Between L* and any tone**: Monotonic (linear)
- **Between L and H in general**: Monotonic

## Phonetic Implementation

### F0 Scaling - The Baseline Transform

$$
\hat{P} = \frac{P - B}{B}
$$

Where:
- P = F0 value in Hz
- B = baseline value at that location
- P-hat = value in "baseline units above baseline"

### Baseline Properties

- L% is the only tone ON the baseline (value = 0)
- All other tones are ABOVE the baseline
- Baseline declines through utterance (declination)
- Total drop is constant regardless of length (~14 Hz male, ~33 Hz female)
- Slope varies inversely with utterance length

### Downstep Produces Exponential Decay

$$
H_{n} = V \cdot k^n
$$

Where:
- V = /H_1/ (first H value in baseline units)
- k = downstep coefficient (~0.60)
- n = number of downsteps

### Upstep Formula

$$
T_{n+1} = (1-a) \cdot T_n + a \cdot t
$$

Where:
- a = step factor (~0.2)
- t = target/ceiling (~3 baseline units)

This produces logarithmic approach to ceiling (opposite of downstep's exponential decay).

### Peak Location Timing

- **H* peak**: Near end of accented syllable
- **L* valley**: At point where rise to following H* starts
- **L*+H- timing**: H- occurs at fixed interval (~190-200 ms) after L*
- **Phrase accent**: At boundary of word carrying nuclear accent

### Prominence Effects

- Increased prominence → H* goes UP (toward ceiling)
- Increased prominence → L* goes DOWN (saturates toward baseline)
- Prominence is continuously variable
- Prominence of metrically stronger accent ≥ weaker accent

## Key Equations

### Peak Scaling
$$
\hat{P} = \frac{P - b_p}{b_p}
$$

### Peak Ratio (Two-accent phrase)
$$
\hat{A} = c \cdot \hat{B}
$$
Where c ≈ 1.4-1.5 (speaker-dependent)

### BA Order Peak Relation
$$
P_2 = c(b_2/b_1) P_1 + (1-c)b_2
$$

### AB Order Peak Relation
$$
P_2 = (1/c)(b_2/b_1) P_1 + (1-1/c)b_2
$$

### Downstep Sequence
$$
T_{n} = k^n \cdot H_1
$$

### General Recursive Formula (Downstep + Upstep)
$$
|T_{n+1}| = (1-a) \cdot |T_n| + a \cdot t \quad \text{where } 0 < a < 1
$$

For downstep: t = 0 (asymptotic to baseline)
For upstep: t = ceiling (~3 baseline units)

### Prominence-Based H Scaling
$$
/H^*_{i+1}/ = /H^*_i/ \times \frac{\text{Prominence}(H^*_{i+1})}{\text{Prominence}(H^*_i)}
$$

### L* Computation in H-+L*
$$
/L^*/ = k \cdot /H^-/
$$

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS F0 Generation

1. **Baseline tracking**:
   - Establish speaker-dependent baseline (87-158 Hz for males, higher for females)
   - Decline baseline linearly: slope = total_drop / utterance_duration
   - All tonal targets computed relative to baseline

2. **Left-to-right processing**:
   - Process tones strictly left to right
   - Each tone's value depends only on immediately preceding tone
   - No lookahead required
   - First H* is free (set by pragmatics/emphasis)

3. **Downstep implementation**:
   - Track whether previous accent contained L component
   - After H+L or L+H pattern, multiply reference by k (~0.6)
   - Use exponential decay: `H_next = k * H_current`
   - Values in baseline units, convert to Hz only at end

4. **Upstep implementation**:
   - After H- phrase accent, add /H-/ value to boundary tone
   - L% after H- stays at H- level (not falling to baseline)
   - H% after H- is raised higher than H% after L-

5. **Interpolation strategy**:
   - H* to H*: Compute local minimum based on time/frequency separation (dipping)
   - L* to anything: Linear interpolation
   - Closer H*s → less dipping; sufficiently close → no dipping

6. **Phrase-final contour**:
   - Nuclear pitch accent (on stressed syllable)
   - Phrase accent (at end of word with nuclear stress)
   - Boundary tone (at phrase edge)

7. **Spreading implementation**:
   - H- spreads (maintains level) until H% or L% at phrase end
   - L- spreads before H% but falls gradually before L%

8. **Finite state machine**: The system can be implemented as FSM since:
   - Each tone value depends only on immediately preceding pitch accent
   - No lookahead required
   - Values once computed are not modified

### Algorithm for Downstepped Sequences

```
1. INITIALIZE: Set first H* to speaker's reference value (e.g., 3 baseline units)

2. For each subsequent tone:
   a. If computing H- from H*:
      H- = H* * (prominence_ratio)

   b. If computing L* from H-:
      L* = k * H-  (where k ≈ 0.6)

   c. If computing H- from previous H- with downstep:
      H-_new = k * H-_prev  (DOWNSTEP TRIGGER)

   d. INTERPOLATE between computed targets

3. Convert baseline units to Hz: actual_F0 = baseline * (1 + target)
```

### Impossible Contours to Avoid

- Sustained flat plateaus at phrase accent level without boundary movement
- Sharp triangular peaks at phrase boundaries
- H*+H- followed by another H*+H- in sequence
- Any pattern where F0 violates monotonicity constraints between adjacent targets

## Results Summary

1. The two-tone theory (H, L) with local implementation rules successfully generates all observed English intonation patterns
2. Downstep coefficient k ≈ 0.60 produces exponential decay fitting data 3x better than constant-interval models
3. The baseline model allows cross-speaker and cross-range comparison
4. Tonal implementation rules are local (no lookahead) and iterative (left-to-right)
5. The system is compositional: phrase-final contour = nuclear accent + phrase accent + boundary tone

## Limitations

1. **Timing of unstarred tones**: The precise timing of trailing tones in bitonal accents needs more investigation
2. **Scaling of baseline units**: May arise from respiratory/laryngeal interaction - physiological basis unclear
3. **Interpolation character**: Different interpolation algorithms could yield different tonal analyses
4. **Prosodic phrasing**: Rules for intonational phrase boundary placement not fully specified
5. **Semantic/pragmatic mapping**: How meaning maps to tune choice not formalized

## Relevance to TTS

This thesis provides the foundation for the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) annotation system used in modern TTS. For Qlatt prosody:

1. **F0 contour generation**: Use the finite-state grammar to generate valid tone sequences, then apply left-to-right implementation rules
2. **Pitch range**: Compute all targets in baseline units, scale to speaker range at synthesis time
3. **Downstep**: Implement exponential decay with k ≈ 0.6 for natural-sounding declaratives
4. **Questions**: Use H% boundary tone for yes/no questions (final rise)
5. **Stress-F0 relationship**: Higher prominence → higher H*, lower L*
6. **Phrase boundaries**: Insert phrase accent + boundary tone at syntactic boundaries

## Open Questions

1. What determines the choice of pitch accent type for a given focus structure?
2. How do L tones in bitonal accents affect timing?
3. What is the physiological basis for the baseline?
4. How should interpolation differ between different tone sequences?
5. What controls the degree of downstep (variation in k)?
