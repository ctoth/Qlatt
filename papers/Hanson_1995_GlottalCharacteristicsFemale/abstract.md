# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The aim of the research reported in this thesis is to develop a set of descriptors of the voicing source that reflect individual differences in the vocal quality of female speakers. The descriptors are derived from measurements of the spectra of vowels produced by the speakers.

The configuration of the membranous part of the vocal folds and the arytenoid cartilages shapes the airflow waveform that passes through the glottis during phonation and affects the amount of turbulent noise that is generated at the glottis. Theoretical analysis and observations of experimental data suggest that a more open glottal configuration results in a glottal waveform with relatively greater low-frequency and weaker high-frequency components, compared to a waveform produced with a more adducted glottal configuration. This more open glottal configuration should also result in a greater source of aspiration noise and larger bandwidths of the natural frequencies of the vocal tract (formants), particularly the first formant. These effects of glottal configuration are theorized to be measurable directly from the speech spectrum or waveform. In our work we have developed such acoustic measurements. By applying these measurements to the speech of a group of female speakers, we have shown that they can be used to classify speakers according to glottal configuration. Physiological measures derived from airflow waveforms and fiberoptic observations for a subset of the subjects are in accord with the classifications based on acoustic measurements. These classifications have also been found to be correlated with perceived voice quality. Through a speech synthesis experiment, we found that the variations in glottal characteristics observed in our group of female subjects are perceptible and contribute to improved synthesis of a given female's speech.

This research contributes to the literature that seeks to describe the normal variation of voicing characteristics across speakers, and therefore has implications for speech and speaker recognition. In addition, it contributes to a continuing effort to improve the analysis and synthesis of female speech, which have often been termed 'difficult'. Furthermore, this research may have diagnostic and therapeutic applications in clinical settings.

## Our Interpretation

This thesis develops acoustic measures to quantify differences in female voice quality through glottal configuration, showing that spectral tilt and formant bandwidth changes directly reflect how open or closed the vocal folds are during phonation. The research establishes that acoustic measurements (H1*-A3* spectral tilt, H1*-A1 bandwidth) can reliably classify speakers by voice quality and validates these acoustic measures against physiological data, with perceptual testing confirming that these variations are audible and improve synthesis naturalness. This work is essential for speech synthesis because it provides scientifically grounded acoustic parameters and measurement techniques for modeling realistic female voice quality variation in formant synthesizers like Klatt, moving beyond arbitrary parameter tuning to principled control based on human phonatory physiology.
