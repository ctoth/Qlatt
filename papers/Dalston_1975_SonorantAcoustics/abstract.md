# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

This report presents the results of a spectrographic analysis of word-initial allophones of /w/, /r/, and /l/ produced by three- to four-year-old children and adults. Information was obtained concerning formant frequencies, steady-state durations, transition durations, and transition rates of each of the first three formants of these sonorants. The results demonstrate that the phonemes investigated are distinguishable on the basis of their temporal, as well as their spectral, acoustic characteristics.

## Our Interpretation

This paper provides detailed acoustic measurements of the English sonorants /w/, /r/, and /l/ as spoken by both young children and adults, showing that these sounds can be distinguished by both formant frequencies and timing characteristics. The key contribution is demonstrating that temporal features (duration and transition rates) play an important role alongside spectral features in differentiating these sounds, which may explain why children struggle with these late-developing phonemes. For speech synthesis, this work provides reference formant values and duration patterns essential for generating natural-sounding sonorant realizations.
