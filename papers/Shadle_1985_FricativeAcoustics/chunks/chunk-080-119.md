## Key Findings

### Transfer Function Modeling
- Three models of increasing realism and complexity analyzed (Models I, II, III)
- Model I: Front-cavity-only configuration with infinite constriction impedance
- Model II: Constriction modeled with finite impedance terminated on upstream end by short circuit
- Model III: Back cavity and "glottis" added to Model II
- TBFDA program used to generate transfer functions by solving plane-wave propagation equations iteratively

### Low-Frequency Behavior
- Model I has single zero at 0 Hz
- Model II has pole at 0 Hz and zeros corresponding to Helmholtz resonance of constriction
- Model III has zero at 0 Hz, pole pair due to Helmholtz resonance of back cavity and constriction, and zero pair due to all three elements
- Low-frequency Model I not too inaccurate above 500 Hz for thinking about behavior

### Higher-Frequency Behavior
- Poles satisfy: cosh(gamma_f * l_f) = 0, giving resonance frequencies
- For front cavity length l_f = 3.2 cm: poles at 2690 Hz, 8080 Hz (viscosity/heat only)
- For front cavity length l_f = 12 cm: poles at 718 Hz, 2155 Hz, 3590 Hz, 5030 Hz, 6465 Hz, 7900 Hz, 9340 Hz
- Radiation impedance significantly increases bandwidths (e.g., 220-2540 Hz for l_f = 3.2 cm with radiation)

### Bandwidth Contributions
- Sources of loss: viscosity, heat conduction, radiation, constriction resistance
- Constriction adds significant bandwidth contribution at low frequencies
- Glottal losses contribute constant bandwidth across frequency range
- Back cavity resonances have low bandwidths (~165 Hz for higher poles)

### Experimental Method
- Air from pressurized tank through flowmeter and muffler into tube
- Bruel and Kjaer microphone, HP spectrum analyzer, VAX computer analysis
- Tube: 17 cm long, 2.54 cm inner diameter plastic tube
- Constriction: 1 cm long, 0.32 cm diameter tapered inlet
- Obstacle: 3 cm downstream of constriction (plexiglass baffle or fiberglass)
- Muffler absorbs sounds about 20 dB in 500-1500 Hz range, 30 dB in 1.5-6 kHz range

### Source Spectrum Characteristics
- Room noise fit: p_hat = a * log_10(f) + b
- Free jet spectrum has broad peak at 0.2V/d Hz (V = jet velocity, d = nozzle diameter)
- Spectrum slope: -6 dB/octave expected, measured slopes -7 to -14 dB depending on octave

## Equations Found (LaTeX)

### Transfer Function - Model I (Low Frequency)
$$
\frac{U_{out}}{p_s} = sC_f
$$
Where: C_f = front cavity compliance

### Transfer Function - Model II (Low Frequency, without loss)
$$
\frac{U_{out}}{p_s} = C_f \frac{s^2 + \frac{1}{L_c C_f}}{s}
$$
Where: L_c = constriction inductance, C_f = front cavity compliance

### Transfer Function - Model II (with loss)
$$
\frac{U_{out}}{p_s} = C_f \frac{s^2 + s\frac{R_c}{L_c} + \frac{1}{L_c C_f}}{s + R_c/L_c}
$$

### Model II Pole and Zero Locations (Eq. 3.8)
$$
\text{pole: } s = -\frac{R_c}{L_c}
$$
$$
\text{zeros: } s = -\frac{R_c}{2L_c} \pm \frac{1}{2L_c}\sqrt{\frac{R_c^2}{L_c} - \frac{4}{L_c C_f}}
$$

### Transfer Function - Model III (without loss)
$$
\frac{U_{out}}{p_s} = C_f \frac{s^3 + s\left(\frac{C_b + C_f}{C_f C_b L_c}\right)}{s^2 + \left(\frac{1}{C_b L_c}\right)}
$$

### Higher Frequency Model - Pole Frequencies (Eq. 3.9, 3.10)
$$
\cosh \gamma_f l_f = 0
$$
$$
\gamma_f l_f = (\alpha_f + j\beta)l_f \simeq \pm j\frac{(2n+1)\pi}{2}, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
$$
$$
f = \frac{(2n+1)c}{4l_f}, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
$$
$$
\Delta f = \frac{\alpha_f c}{\pi}
$$

### Zero Frequencies for Back Cavity (Eq. 3.11)
$$
f = \frac{\omega_m}{2\pi} = \frac{mc}{2l_o} \text{ Hz}, \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
$$
$$
\Delta f = \frac{\sigma_m}{\pi} = \frac{\alpha_o c}{\pi}
$$

### Radiation Effect on Poles (Eq. 3.12)
$$
s_n \simeq \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\beta_R}{\beta_n}}\left[-(\alpha + \alpha_R)c \pm j\frac{(2n+1)\pi c}{2l}\right]
$$

### Q Factor Definition (Eq. 3.13)
$$
Q = 2\pi \frac{\text{energy stored in front cavity}}{\text{energy lost per cycle}} = \frac{f}{\Delta f}
$$

### Bandwidth from Q (Eq. 3.14)
$$
\Delta f = \frac{f}{Q} = \frac{\rho c^2 R_c}{\pi A_f l (R_c^2 + (\omega L_c)^2)}
$$

### Glottal Loss Bandwidth
$$
\Delta f_g = \frac{c A_g}{\pi A_b l_b}
$$
- l_f = 3.2 cm: Delta_f = 164 Hz
- l_f = 12 cm: Delta_f = 525 Hz

### Total Bandwidth
$$
\Delta f_c = \frac{\rho c^2}{\pi A_b l_b}\left(\frac{R_c}{R_c^2 + (\omega L_c)^2}\right)
$$
$$
\Delta f_{tot} = \frac{c}{\pi A_b l_b}\left(A_g + \frac{\rho c R_c}{R_c^2 + (\omega L_c)^2}\right)
$$

### Predicted Output (Eq. 3.15)
$$
P_l(s) = \frac{S_1(s)N_1(s) + S_2(s)N_2(s) + \cdots + S_n(s)N_n(s)}{D_l(s)}
$$

### Pressure Exponent Relationship
$$
20 \log_{10}|p(V)| = a \log_{10} V + b
$$
$$
\frac{n}{2} = \frac{20\log_{10}P_2 - 20\log_{10}P_1}{20\log_{10}(V_2/V_1)}
$$

### Acoustic Line Source Model (Fig. 3.17)
$$
v_r(x,t) = \begin{cases} 0 & x < 0, x > L \\ v_0 \sin\frac{2\pi}{\Lambda}(x - V_0 t) & 0 < x < L \end{cases}
$$
Where: Lambda = "wavelength" of flow irregularity, L = jet length

## Rules/Algorithms

### TBFDA Program Usage
1. Specify area function for distributed model
2. Program generates transfer function using plane-wave propagation equations
3. Only pole and zero frequencies generated (for human vocal tract)
4. Bandwidths calculated separately considering:
   - Heat conduction losses
   - Viscosity losses
   - Radiation losses
   - Flow resistance

### Correction Function Procedure for Transfer Functions
1. Consider poles first - normalized allpole function with identical bandwidths
2. Peaks have amplitude A_t = 0 dB, troughs have amplitude A_p (depends on bandwidth)
3. Compute transfer function T_N(f) of N poles
4. Find trough amplitudes B(f(t_i)) at each trough frequency
5. Generate amplitude differences D_t(f(t_i)) = A_t - B(f(t_i))
6. Linearly interpolate between amplitude differences
7. Same procedure for zeros
8. Pole corrections added, zero corrections subtracted from transfer function

### Experimental Procedure
1. Record spectrum at 15 different angles (12 to 92 degrees)
2. Data at 28 degrees used for filtered/raw comparisons
3. Filtered data: inverse filtered to remove tube effect, predict source function
4. Smoothed ambient room noise spectrum subtracted
5. Room noise fit: p_hat = a*log_10(f) + b (least-mean-square fit)

### Source-Tract Interaction Analysis
1. If no interaction: source identical for both configurations at given flowrate
2. Source depends only on constriction shape and size, and flowrate
3. Compare P_3(s)*D_3(s) = P_12(s)*D_12(s) for obstacle vs no-obstacle
4. If equal, sources are identical

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Since the area of the constriction is small relative to the front and back-cavity areas, we expect that there will be little coupling between front and back cavities, so that the effect on the front-cavity resonances will be slight and the back cavity resonance frequencies will be approximately equal to (nc/2l_b), n = 0, 1, 2..." (p. 93)

> "The glottal pipe exits abruptly into the back cavity, but has a tapered inlet from the muffler. Since the muffler presumably absorbs all sound (it actually attenuates sounds about 20 dB in the 500 to 1500 Hz range, and about 30 dB in the 1.5 kHz to 6 kHz range), the glottal pipe acts as a reflectionless tube." (p. 93)

> "In summary, the plane-wave pressure source is a good model for the sound generated at the obstacle, the transmission line works well with fairly predictable problems, and there appears to be very little source-tract interaction. The source model predicts the correct zero frequency (for nonzero front cavity) which means source location and type are essentially correct. The zero bandwidth is too low in all cases, indicating that the source should be slightly distributed (on the order of 1 or 2 mm) longitudinally." (p. 114)

> "Data from numerous experiments have been published showing the overall sound power spectra for free jets, with a broad peak at 0.2V/d Hz (V = jet velocity at the nozzle, d = nozzle diameter) and falling off at an increasing rate of roughly -3, -4, and -5 dB/octave in successive octaves above the peak." (p. 109-110)

## Implementation Notes

### For Fricative Synthesis
1. **Front cavity length determines spectral shape:**
   - Short front cavity (l_f = 3.2 cm, alveolar): fewer resonances in 0-10 kHz, first at ~2700 Hz
   - Long front cavity (l_f = 12 cm, velar): many resonances starting at ~700 Hz

2. **Bandwidth increases with frequency** due to radiation losses - important for realistic spectral envelope

3. **Source spectrum characteristics:**
   - Peak frequency at 0.2V/d (jet velocity / nozzle diameter)
   - Slope: -6 to -9 dB/octave in first octave above peak
   - Steeper slopes (-13 to -14 dB/octave) at higher frequencies
   - Can model as: p_s = a * e^(b*f) for source pressure

4. **Obstacle vs No-Obstacle:**
   - Obstacle case: zeros near 0 Hz from back cavity coupling
   - No-obstacle case: simpler spectrum, fewer low-frequency features
   - Both configurations show similar source-tract relationships

5. **Key frequency relationships:**
   - Front cavity resonances: f_n = (2n+1)c / 4l_f
   - Back cavity resonances: f_m = mc / 2l_b
   - Helmholtz resonance involves constriction mass and cavity compliance

6. **Correction functions needed** to account for:
   - Non-uniform pole spacing
   - Non-constant bandwidths
   - Pole-zero interactions creating spectral ripple

7. **Source is essentially a pressure source** located at the obstacle (or constriction exit for no-obstacle case), slightly distributed longitudinally (1-2 mm)
