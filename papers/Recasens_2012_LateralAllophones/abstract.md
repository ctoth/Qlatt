# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Formant frequency data for /l/ in 23 languages/dialects where the consonant may be typically clear or dark show that the two varieties of /l/ are set in contrast mostly in the context of /i/ but also next to /a/, and that a few languages/dialects may exhibit intermediate degrees of darkness in the consonant. F2 for /l/ is higher utterance initially than utterance finally, more so if the lateral is clear than if it is dark; moreover, the initial and final allophones may be characterized as intrinsic (in most languages/dialects) or extrinsic (in several English dialects, Czech and Dutch) depending on whether the position-dependent frequency difference in question is below or above 200/300 Hz. The paper also reports a larger degree of vowel coarticulation for clear /l/ than for dark /l/ and in initial than in final position. These results are interpreted in terms of the production mechanisms involved in the realization of the two /l/ varieties in the different positional and vowel context conditions subjected to investigation.

## Our Interpretation

This paper provides a comprehensive cross-linguistic acoustic study of /l/ allophones across 23 languages, establishing precise F2 frequency targets that distinguish clear and dark /l/ variants based on vowel context and syllable position. The key findings show that clear /l/ occurs around 1500-2000 Hz F2 while dark /l/ occurs around 800-1200 Hz, with a split boundary around 1300-1400 Hz in /i/ context, and that syllable-initial /l/ is systematically higher in frequency than syllable-final /l/, creating position-dependent allophony that is more pronounced for clear /l/ than dark /l/. For speech synthesis like Klatt, these acoustic patterns directly translate to formant frequency targets and coarticulation rules that enable phonetically accurate /l/ synthesis across different phonetic contexts.
