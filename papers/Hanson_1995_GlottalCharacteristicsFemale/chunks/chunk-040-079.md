## Key Findings

### Spectral Tilt and Closure Time
- The breakpoint frequency for spectral slope change is given by $f_T = \frac{1}{2\pi T} = \frac{1}{\pi T_D}$ where $T_D$ is time from anterior closure to posterior end
- For $T_D = 0.5$ ms, $f_T = 637$ Hz, tilt increase at 2750 Hz is 13 dB
- For $T_D = 1.0$ ms, $f_T = 318$ Hz, tilt increase at 2750 Hz is 19 dB
- Minimum H1-A3 value expected due to 6 dB/octave dropoff is about 9 dB

### Speed Quotient (SQ) Effects
- SQ = 140 (slow closing) vs SQ = 320 (rapid closing) show different spectral characteristics
- Skewing of waveform affects spectrum at middle and high frequencies
- As closing phase becomes faster relative to opening, OQ stays constant but spectrum amplitude at high frequencies increases

### Incomplete Glottal Closure Effects
Four types of glottal configurations during "closed" phase:
1. Arytenoids approximated, membranous folds close abruptly
2. Arytenoids approximated, membranous folds close nonsimultaneously along length
3. Fixed bypass airway ("chink") at arytenoids, folds close abruptly
4. Both vocal processes and arytenoids remain abducted throughout cycle

Acoustic manifestations:
- Increased bandwidth of F1 (and possibly F2)
- Increased tilt in glottal spectrum at high frequencies
- Turbulence noise in vicinity of glottis comparable to periodic source amplitude

### First-Formant Bandwidth
- Closed-glottis B1 for female speakers: 40-95 Hz (Fujimura and Lindqvist, 1971; Fant, 1972)
- When glottis is open with airflow, glottal resistance contributes to F1 bandwidth
- B1 bandwidth can be estimated from F1 waveform decay rate using Eqn. 3.3

### Glottal Chink Parameters (Table 3.1)

*Assuming vocal tract losses contribute 50 Hz, subglottal pressure 5500 dynes/cm^2*

### Turbulence Noise
- Ratio of harmonics at 3 kHz to noise in 50-Hz band at same frequency is 17 dB for modal vibration
- Noise source amplitude increases proportionally to $A_g^{0.5}$ where $A_g$ is average glottal area
- Average glottal area during modal vibration with partial closure: ~0.03 cm^2
- Adding 0.05 cm^2 glottal chink increases turbulence noise by about 4 dB
- This gives 17 dB decrease in harmonics-to-noise ratio in high frequency range

### Female Speaker Measurements (22 subjects, ages 22-49)

- H1* - A3*: 22.5 dB (range 8.6 to 32.8)
- Noise ratings: 2.3 (waveform), 1.9 (spectra)

### Two Groups of Female Speakers
- **Group 1** (11 speakers): H1* - A3* <= 23 dB, abrupt glottal closure, shallow spectral tilt, prominent F1 peaks
- **Group 2** (11 speakers): H1* - A3* > 23 dB, steeper spectral tilt, nonsimultaneous closure along membranous folds

## Equations Found

### Spectral Slope Breakpoint Frequency
$$f_T = \frac{1}{2\pi T} = \frac{1}{\pi T_D}$$
- $T$ = time constant of exponential closure (~half of sliding closure time)
- $T_D$ = time from anterior closure initiation to posterior end
- Above $f_T$, spectrum increases by 12 dB/octave if exponential approximation assumed

### Tilt Increase at F3 (2750 Hz for females)
$$20 \log_{10} \frac{2750}{f_T}$$

### F1 Bandwidth from Waveform Decay
$$B1 = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\ln\left(\frac{X1}{X2}\right)}{\frac{1}{2}(T1 + T2)}$$
- $X1$, $X2$ = peak-to-peak oscillation amplitudes
- $T1$, $T2$ = time between maximum and minimum amplitudes

### Glottal Opening Contribution to B1 (Equivalent Circuit)
$$B_g = \frac{\rho c^2}{\pi A_v \ell_v R_{ch}(1 + \frac{4\pi^2 f^2 M_{ch}^2}{R_{ch}^2})}$$
- $\rho$ = density of air in vocal tract (g/cm^3)
- $c$ = speed of sound (cm/sec)
- $f$ = frequency (Hz)
- $R_{ch}$ = glottal resistance due to chink (dyne-sec/cm^5)
- $M_{ch}$ = acoustic mass of glottal chink (gm/cm^4)

### Pressure Drop Across Glottis
$$\Delta P \approx \frac{\rho U_{ch}^2}{2A_{ch}^2}$$

### Glottal Acoustic Resistance
$$R_{ch} = \frac{d\Delta P}{dU_{ch}} \approx \frac{\rho U_{ch}}{A_{ch}^2}$$

### Subglottal Pressure to Flow Velocity
$$P_s = \frac{\rho U_{ch}^2}{2A_{ch}^2}$$

$$U_{ch} = A_{ch}\sqrt{\frac{2P_s}{\rho}}$$

### Glottal Resistance Approximation
$$R_{ch} \approx \frac{\sqrt{2P_s\rho}}{A_{ch}}$$

### Acoustic Mass of Glottal Chink
$$M_{ch} = \frac{\rho\ell_g}{A_{ch}}$$
- $\ell_g$ = thickness of glottis

### Total Acoustic Mass
$$M = M_{\text{trachea}} + M_{\text{chink}} + M_{\text{vocal tract}}$$

$$M = \rho\left(\frac{\ell_t}{A_t} + \frac{\ell_g}{A_{ch}} + \frac{\ell_v}{A_v}\right)$$
- $\ell_t$ = length of trachea (~11 cm)
- $A_t$ = cross-sectional area of trachea (~2 cm^2)
- $\ell_g$ = effective vertical length of glottis (~0.3 cm)
- $\ell_v$ = length of vocal tract (~15 cm)
- $A_v$ = cross-sectional area of vocal tract (~3 cm^2)

### Simplified Mass and Time Constant
$$M \approx \rho\left(10.5 + \frac{0.3}{A_{ch}}\right)$$

$$R_{ch} \approx \frac{\sqrt{2P_s\rho}}{A_{ch}}$$

$$T = \frac{M}{R_{ch}} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{2P_s}}(10.5A_{ch} + 0.3)$$

### Tilt Breakpoint Frequency
$$f_T = \frac{1}{2\pi T}$$

## Algorithms/Methods

### Measuring F1 Bandwidth from Waveform
1. Bandpass filter waveform with 600 Hz bandwidth centered at F1 frequency
2. Identify first two oscillations during initial (closed) part of glottal cycle
3. Measure peak-to-peak amplitudes X1, X2 and periods T1, T2
4. Apply equation 3.3: $B1 = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\ln(X1/X2)}{\frac{1}{2}(T1+T2)}$
5. Average across 8 consecutive pitch periods
6. Average 40 estimates per speaker for each vowel

### Measuring H1* - H2* (Open Quotient Indicator)
1. Center 22.3 ms Hamming window during initial part of glottal cycle (where F1 bandwidth estimated)
2. Take 8 measurements per vowel token for /ae/
3. Take 3 measurements at midvowel (20 ms apart) for /lambda/ and /epsilon/
4. Correct H1 and H2 for first-formant boosting (see Appendix A.1)
5. Average values for each repetition, then compute mean per speaker

### Measuring H1* - A3* (Spectral Tilt)
1. Estimate A3 using strongest harmonic of F3 peak
2. Correct H1 for F1 and F2 influence (see Appendix A.2)
3. For normalization, set F1=555 Hz and F2=1665 Hz (average F3 for all speakers)
4. Apply F3 bandwidth corrections: +4 dB for /ae/, +3 dB for /epsilon/ (based on male B3 data)

### Noise Rating Procedure
1. Bandpass filter vowels around F3 (600 Hz bandwidth)
2. Two judges independently rate noise on scale 1-4:
   - 1 = no evidence of noise interference
   - 4 = little evidence of periodicity
3. Ratings made from both waveforms and spectra
4. Average waveform and spectra ratings (r > 0.92 correlation)

### Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio Calculation
1. Calculate spectrum with 22.3 ms Hamming window (bandwidth ~90 Hz)
2. Measure level of harmonic with greatest amplitude in F3 region
3. Measure aspiration noise level in 50-Hz band at same frequency (3 kHz)
4. HNR = harmonic level - noise level (in dB)
5. For synthesized vowels, HNR of 8 dB corresponds to just-noticeable noise

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The amplitude of the third formant (A3) is also influenced by the locations of F1 and F2. Unless a correction is made for this effect (see Appendix A.2), values of A3 compared across vowels or speakers must be interpreted with caution." (page 41)

> "A minimum H1 - A3 value that can be expected due to the 6 dB/octave dropoff in the source spectrum can be estimated using glottal waveforms synthesized with either the LF model (Fant et al., 1985) or the KLGLOTT88 model (Klatt and Klatt, 1990). When the Klatt model is used to synthesize a source waveform with a fundamental frequency of 200 Hz, an open quotient of 50 percent, and no additional tilt, the difference between the amplitudes of the first harmonic and the harmonic at 3000 Hz is about 21 dB." (page 41)

> "For a neutral vocal tract setting (Fant, 1972), is about 12.6 dB, and the resulting H1 - A3 is 7.4 dB. To this we can add 1-2 dB because F3 will, on average, not be centered exactly on a harmonic, bringing the minimum H1 - A3 measure to about 9 dB." (page 41)

> "When the glottal area does not decrease to zero over a cycle of vibration, the spectra given by solid lines in Fig. 3.9 change in two ways. The spectrum amplitude of the periodic component becomes weaker at high frequencies, as noted above, and the amplitude of the turbulence noise increases because of the increased flow." (page 55)

> "The wide ranges of parameter values that we have observed suggest that consideration of glottal characteristics has great importance for describing female speech and, in addition to formant frequencies and fundamental frequency, should be taken into account for applications such as synthesis and recognition of speech and speakers." (page 79)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Voice Source
1. **Spectral tilt (TL parameter):** Range of H1*-A3* from 8.6 to 35.0 dB for females indicates TL should vary substantially for natural female voice quality. Minimum ~9 dB corresponds to complete abrupt closure.

2. **First-formant bandwidth (B1):** For female synthesis, B1 should range from 53-280 Hz depending on voice quality. Lower values (50-100 Hz) for pressed/modal voice, higher values (150-280 Hz) for breathy voice with glottal chink.

3. **Aspiration noise (AH parameter):** HNR of 8 dB is threshold for perceptible breathiness. For breathy female voices, set aspiration level so that noise at F3 frequency is within 8 dB of harmonic level.

4. **Open quotient effects on H1-H2:** Range of 0.6-6.8 dB for H1*-H2* indicates moderate OQ variation among female speakers. This affects low-frequency spectral balance.

5. **Two voice quality groups:**
   - Group 1 (modal): H1*-A3* <= 23 dB, B1 low (53-100 Hz), prominent F1, low noise
   - Group 2 (breathy): H1*-A3* > 23 dB, B1 higher, reduced F1 prominence, more noise

6. **Glottal chink modeling:** For incomplete closure, both B1 increase and tilt increase should covary. Table 3.1 provides quantitative relationships between chink area, B1, tilt, and flow.

7. **Female vs male differences:** Female F3 is around 2750 Hz (vs ~2500 Hz for males). Spectral tilt effects are measured relative to F3 region. Female B1 values tend to be higher due to more common incomplete closure.

8. **Noise source spectrum:** For turbulence noise modeling, spectrum amplitude in 50-Hz bands should be set so that at 3 kHz the periodic-to-noise ratio matches target HNR. Values from -10 to +20 dB HNR span the perceptual range.
