## Key Findings

### Burst Frequency by Place of Articulation

- **/k/ burst frequency** varies strongly with vowel context:
  - Front vowels: ~3.5-4 kHz
  - Back unrounded vowels: ~2.7 kHz
  - Back rounded vowels: ~1.25 kHz (lowest)
  - Mean across all vowels: ~2 kHz

- **/g/ burst frequency** shows same vowel dependency as /k/:
  - Front vowels: ~2.7 kHz
  - Back unrounded vowels: ~1.77 kHz
  - Back rounded vowels: ~1.25 kHz
  - Distribution spans 1-4 kHz with bimodal peaks around 2 kHz and 3 kHz (page 122)

- **/t/ burst frequency**: relatively invariant across vowel contexts
  - Most energy concentrated around 3-4 kHz
  - Mean ~3.5 kHz for singleton /t/

- **/d/ burst frequency**: similar to /t/ but 200-300 Hz lower
  - Voiced dental has burst frequency 200-300 Hz less than voiceless counterpart

### Burst Amplitude Measurements

**Table 5.II - Average Relative Burst Amplitude for Singleton Stops (page 125):**

| Stop | Average Burst Amplitude (dB) |
|------|------------------------------|
| /t/  | +2.4                         |
| /k/  | -1.8                         |
| /d/  | -0.4                         |
| /g/  | -3.4                         |

Key findings:
- Voiceless stops are ~2 dB louder than voiced counterparts
- Dentals have greater burst amplitude than velars
- Burst amplitude for dentals and velars is approximately same as following vowel amplitude

**Table 5.III - Decrease in Overall RMS Amplitude from Singleton to Clusters (page 126):**

| Stop | Stop-Sonorant Clusters | /s/-Stop Clusters |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|
| /p/  | -0.2                   | -2.0              |
| /t/  | 2.3                    | 5.0               |
| /k/  | 8.2                    | 3.0               |
| /b/  | -0.6                   | --                |
| /d/  | 4.0                    | --                |
| /g/  | 8.7                    | --                |

- For stop-sonorant clusters: marked decrease (~8 dB) in RMS amplitude for velars
- Labials show little change in RMS amplitude
- For /s/-stop clusters: both dentals and velars show decrease

**Table 5.IV - Increase in Relative Burst Amplitude from Singleton to Clusters (page 134):**

| Stop | Stop-Sonorant Clusters | /s/-Stop Clusters |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|
| /t/  | 3.5                    | -2.0              |
| /k/  | -4.7                   | -3.0              |
| /d/  | 1.5                    | --                |
| /g/  | -3.7                   | --                |

### Burst Frequency in Clusters

- **/t/ in /tr/ clusters**: 2,460 Hz average (decrease of >1000 Hz from singleton)
- **/t/ in /tw/ clusters**: 2,570 Hz (slightly higher than /tr/)
- **/d/ in /dr/ clusters**: 2,120 Hz
- **/d/ in /dw/ clusters**: 2,210 Hz
- **/t/ in /st/ clusters**: 3,240 Hz (closer to singleton /d/ than /t/)
- **/k/ in /sk/ clusters**: 2,010 Hz (same as singleton /g/)

**Velar burst frequencies in stop-sonorant clusters:**
- Preceding /l/: 1,320 Hz for /k/, 1,230 Hz for /g/
- Preceding /r/: 1,240 Hz for /k/, 1,190 Hz for /g/
- Preceding /w/: 1,050 Hz for /k/, 980 Hz for /g/ (lowest)

### Voiced vs Voiceless Distinctions

- No difference in burst frequency for voiceless vs voiced velars
- Voiced dental /d/ has burst frequency 200-300 Hz less than /t/ in same environment
- Burst frequency for voiceless unaspirated /t/ (in clusters) corresponds closer to /d/ than aspirated /t/

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesis

1. **Burst Frequency Rules by Place:**
   - Labials: weak burst, no clear spectral peak (excluded from most analysis)
   - Dentals /t,d/: burst around 3-4 kHz, relatively invariant with vowel
   - Velars /k,g/: burst frequency highly vowel-dependent:
     - Before front vowels: ~3-4 kHz
     - Before back vowels: ~1.5-2 kHz
     - Before rounded vowels: further 550 Hz lowering

2. **Burst Amplitude Rules:**
   - Voiceless stops: +2 dB relative to voiced
   - Labials: 12 dB weaker than dentals/velars (often imperceptible)
   - Burst amplitude approximately equals following vowel amplitude for dentals/velars

3. **Cluster Effects:**
   - Stop-sonorant clusters: burst frequency lowered due to coarticulation
   - /s/-stop clusters: voiceless stops behave like voiced counterparts
   - Rounding and retroflexing cause similar burst frequency lowering

4. **Voiced/Voiceless Frequency Shift:**
   - Voiced dental burst ~200-300 Hz lower than voiceless
   - No frequency difference for velars across voicing

5. **Perceptual Importance:**
   - For labials, burst spectral concentration may be less important than amplitude
   - Labials identified more by VOT and formant transitions

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The average burst amplitude of the voiceless stops is consistently greater, by about 2 dB, than that of the voiced stops. The burst amplitude is greater for dentals than for velars. The averaged burst amplitude for the dentals and the velars is about the same as that of the following vowel." (page 123)

> "The average RMS amplitudes for the labials were some 12 dB less than the dentals and the velars. This weak release makes it extremely difficult to locate the burst frequency." (page 135)

> "The fact that the labials lack a clear, distinct burst frequency raises the question of whether the burst frequency is a perceptually important cue in the identification of the labials." (page 135)

> "The burst frequency for the dentals was found to have a distribution that is bi-modal in nature. Bursts for /t,d/ preceding rounded vowels were found to be 600 Hz lower than those preceding all other vowels." (page 136)

> "The average burst frequencies for /k,g/ preceding front and back vowels differ by 1,200 Hz. For the back vowels, the bursts for /k,g/ are 550 Hz lower preceding rounded vowels than preceding unrounded vowels." (page 136)

> "We have found essentially no difference in burst frequency values for the voiceless and voiced velars. There is, however, a consistent tendency for the voiced dental to have a burst frequency that is 200 to 300 Hz less than its voiceless counterpart under the same phonetic environment." (page 139)

> "Based on the measurements on the burst durations of the voiced and voiceless stops, Klatt [Klatt 1975] has estimated that the difference in duration alone can make the burst of a voiceless stop be perceived as at least 4 dB louder." (page 141)

> "The feature voicing, for example, manifests itself in a difference in fundamental frequency, voice-onset time, burst amplitude, and a multitude of others. All things being equal, each of these dimensions might be sufficient in making the voice-voiceless distinction." (page 145)
