This paper proposes treating formant transitions as independent temporal units separate from steady-state phones, using a multi-stream delta representation to simplify synthesis rules for duration, aspiration, and coarticulation. The key finding is the stable transition phenomenon: formant transitions between phones maintain consistent durations even when vowels lengthen or shorten before voiced versus voiceless obstruents, while the steady-state portions stretch. This model is critical for speech synthesis because it separates durationally stable acoustic movements from phonologically-driven duration changes, enabling simpler and more accurate rules for duration, aspiration timing, and the treatment of diphthongs versus gliding vowels.
