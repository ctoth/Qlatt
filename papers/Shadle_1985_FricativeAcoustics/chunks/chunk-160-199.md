## Key Findings

### Fricative-Whistle Transition (Section 4.2.4)
- Only /phi, s, sh/ can merge into whistles with minor adjustments of airflow and articulator positions
- For /phi/ the adjustment is most profound: pursing lips to form circular opening, tightening, and raising tongue slightly
- Bilabial whistle couples into second formant, defined mainly by tongue position in anterior-posterior direction
- Mechanical model with A_m = 0.08 cm^2 will NOT whistle at any flowrate 0-520 cc/sec
- Mechanical model with A_t = 0.71 cm^2 and A_m = 0.32 cm^2 WILL whistle for at least some flowrates
- Whistle occurs at half-wavelength resonances of the entire tract, slightly affected by upstream constriction location
- Whistle frequency changes in flowrate for given configuration cause whistle frequency to fluctuate and amplitude to increase/decrease
- When A_t = 0.32 and A_m = 0.71 cm^2, two resonances occur only 300 Hz apart (double-peaked whistle)
- Humans can whistle up to 4000 Hz by decreasing cross-sectional area of front cavity as tongue moves forward

### Whistle Mechanism
- /s, sh/ whistles are produced by edgetones
- /phi/ whistles are due to holetones (ring vortices from two colinear orifices)
- Jet produced by upstream constriction is unstable; reinforced by reflections from downstream constriction
- Train of ring vortices generates sound that excites and couples into cavity resonances

### Three-Class Fricative Model (Section 4.3)
- Fricatives fell into three classes according to dominant source mechanism:
  1. **/s, sh/**: Jet impinges on obstacle/teeth, producing high-amplitude spectrum with few obvious poles; series pressure source at obstacle location
  2. **/c, x/**: Front cavity is relatively long, sound generated by jet action on wall of tube; mimicked by relatively high amplitude with well-defined resonances (spectra from palate/alveolar ridge)
  3. **/phi, f, theta/**: Constriction is located forward in tract; shape of constriction crucial; jet contacts surfaces producing high-amplitude spectra; theoretical models need distributed source + evanescent/longitudinal modes

### Spectral Source Slopes (Fant's Specifications)
- /f/: -6 dB/oct between 800 and 10000 Hz, or -3 dB/oct between 800 and 10000 Hz (better fit)
- /s/: 0 dB/oct, 800 to 4000 Hz; -6 dB/oct, 4000 to 10000 Hz
- /sh/: apical source of 0 dB/oct from 300 to 6000 Hz, or dental source of 0 dB/oct from 300 to 2000 Hz, -12 dB/oct from 2000 to 10000 Hz
- /x/: -6 dB/oct between 300 and 4000 Hz

### Chapter 5 Summary
- Simple linear source-filter model works well for obstacle case (/s, sh/)
- The obstacle case source was derived from far-field sound pressure when obstacle is mounted flush with baffle downstream of constriction; directivity pattern similar to dipole
- No-obstacle case more complex: shows evidence of source-tract interaction at walls and sometimes at mouth of tube
- For /phi, f, theta/, theoretical models likely need distributed pressure source representing sound generated along roof of mouth
- Mechanical models very good at predicting /s, sh/ spectra; anomaly with /s/ vs Ch. 3 models disappeared when compared to more realistic models
- Models for /c, x/ also very good

### Future Work Directions
- Source-tract interaction needs further investigation
- Source description should include jet parameters (U, d, shape of constriction) and location of all surfaces contacted by jet
- Geometry of tract for all non-whistling cases would be included in filter descriptions
- For /s, sh/ models: series of pressure sources at obstacle/teeth
- For /c, x/ models: distributed pressure source along roof of mouth
- For /phi, f, theta/ models: distributed pressure source + evanescent/longitudinal modes due to short front cavity
- Perceptual studies would increase relevance for speech synthesis

## Rules/Algorithms

### Conditions for Whistle Production
1. A_m = 0.08 cm^2 alone will NOT whistle at any flowrate (0-520 cc/sec)
2. Need A_t >= 0.71 cm^2 AND A_m >= 0.32 cm^2 for whistle
3. Downstream inlet must be abrupt (tapered inlets reduce whistle clarity)
4. Whistle couples to half-wavelength resonances of front cavity
5. Whistle frequency increases with flowrate (frequency jumps to higher amplitude peak)

### Source Model Selection Rules
1. **Obstacle present** (jet hits teeth/obstacle): Use series pressure source at obstacle location; dipole-like directivity
2. **No obstacle, long front cavity** (/c, x/): Use distributed pressure source along roof of mouth
3. **No obstacle, short front cavity** (/phi, f, theta/): Use distributed pressure source + consider evanescent and longitudinal modes

### Spectrum Analysis Calibration (Appendix A)
1. Calibrate Bruel & Kjaer microphone using General Radio 1562-A Sound Level Calibrator
2. Use AR-2A loudspeaker with white noise generator for reference
3. Apply correction factor s = 1.1 dB constant across all frequencies
4. Apply -1.76 dB correction for Hanning window overlap

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The principle conclusion is that even highly simplified mechanical models can mimic speech spectra with a fair degree of success, and thus provide a useful domain in which to explore the parameters controlling sound production due to turbulence in the vocal tract." (p. 173)

> "For /s, sh/, the jet impinges on an obstacle at the teeth. Theoretical models for /phi, f, theta/ are likely to include a distributed source as well, of uncertain type, and may need to include evanescent as well as longitudinal modes due to the shortness of the front cavity." (p. 173)

> "A major finding of this thesis is that the simple linear source-filter model works well in the obstacle case." (p. 183)

> "Very good models of /s/ and /sh/ were obtained by using an obstacle at right angles to the flow and varying the constriction location. For the fricatives /phi, f, theta/, in which the constriction is located forward in the tract, the shape of the constriction was crucial." (p. 183-184)

> "Comparison of the spectra produced by these more complex models to the fricative spectra in terms of the various spectral parameters showed that the models for /s, sh/ are very good, as are those for /c, x/." (p. 173)

> "For the no-obstacle case, it was not possible to derive a source from a free-field measurement, so absolute level of the prediction could not be checked." (p. 183)

> "The slopes specified by Fant are quite similar to those listed in Table 3.6. For /s/, the constriction is closer to the teeth than in /sh/, which should cause the peak frequency to be higher. Indeed, the breakpoint between flat and decreasing slopes, as specified by Fant, is at a higher frequency for /s/." (p. 184)

## Implementation Notes

### For Synthesizing Fricatives

1. **Source Characteristics by Fricative Class:**
   - **/s, sh/ (sibilants)**: High-amplitude noise source; model as pressure source at obstacle (teeth) location
     - /s/: 0 dB/oct 800-4000 Hz, -6 dB/oct 4000-10000 Hz
     - /sh/: 0 dB/oct 300-6000 Hz (apical) or 0 dB/oct 300-2000 Hz, -12 dB/oct 2000-10000 Hz (dental)
   - **/f, theta/ (non-sibilants)**: Lower amplitude; -6 dB/oct or -3 dB/oct slope 800-10000 Hz
   - **/x/ (velar)**: -6 dB/oct 300-4000 Hz

2. **Key Geometric Parameters:**
   - Constriction area A_c ~ 0.08 cm^2 (typical for all fricatives)
   - Front cavity length l_f: 1-2 cm for /s/, 2-3 cm for /sh/, 4-6 cm for /x, c/
   - Obstacle distance from constriction critical for /s, sh/

3. **Teeth Effect:**
   - Teeth add significant high-frequency energy (especially for /s, theta/)
   - Without teeth: spectra lack characteristic high-frequency peak
   - Model as additional obstacle/reflector in the acoustic path

4. **Whistle Avoidance:**
   - Whistles occur when A_m >= 0.32 cm^2 and A_t >= 0.71 cm^2 at certain flowrates
   - Tapered downstream constriction reduces whistle tendency
   - Sustained fricatives typically avoid whistle region

5. **Dynamic Range:**
   - FTP (flat-topped plug) configurations have ~28 dB dynamic range
   - Circle configurations have ~10-20 dB less dynamic range at low frequencies
   - Total overall amplitude 40-65 dB SPL typical

6. **Transfer Function Characteristics:**
   - Obstacle case: poles and zeros closely spaced (pole-zero pairs)
   - No-obstacle case: poles only, with increasing bandwidth at higher frequencies
   - First pole around 700-2200 Hz depending on front cavity length
