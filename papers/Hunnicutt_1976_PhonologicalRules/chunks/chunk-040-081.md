## Key Findings

### Stress Rule Accuracy
- Brown Corpus test with 4,725 words yielded:
  - 1-5 letter words: 82% acceptable pronunciation
  - 7-letter words: 73% acceptable
  - 12-21 letter words: 65% acceptable
- Acceptable = matches Webster's Third International Dictionary (preferred or alternate)

## Equations Found (LaTeX)

### Alternating Stress Rule (p. 41)
Algorithmic order:
1. If 2+ syllables precede primary-stressed vowel in last syllable AND first of these is single vowel: place primary stress 2 syllables left
2. Else if 3+ syllables to left AND second is single vowel: place primary stress 3 syllables left
3. Otherwise no stress assignment

### Destressing Rule (p. 42)
$$V \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} -\text{long} \\ -\text{stress} \end{bmatrix} / \left[ C_0 \quad (VC_0X)_a \quad \begin{bmatrix} (-\text{long})_b \end{bmatrix} C \quad \begin{bmatrix} V \\ +\text{stress} \end{bmatrix} Y \right]$$

Conditions:
1. If $()_a$ not present, $()_b$ must be present
2. Not applied to first vowel if applied to second vowel

### Compound Stress Rule (p. 43)
$$\begin{bmatrix} V \\ 1 \text{ stress} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow [1 \text{ stress}] / \left[ X \quad Y \quad \{VC_0\} \quad \left( \begin{bmatrix} /i/ \\ -\text{stress} \end{bmatrix} \right) \right]$$

Conditions:
1. Y contains no 1 stress
2. If rightmost morph is suffix, check for special stress retention or exclusion category

### Strong First Syllable Rule (p. 46)
$$V \rightarrow [2 \text{ stress}] / \left[ C_0 \quad \begin{bmatrix} \overline{+\text{long}} \end{bmatrix}_a (C_2)_b \quad Y \right]$$

Condition: $()_a$ or $()_b$ must be present

### Cursory Rule (p. 47)
$$V \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} -\text{long} \\ -\text{stress} \end{bmatrix} / \left[ X - \begin{bmatrix} V \\ 1 \text{ stress} \end{bmatrix} C_0 \quad CV \quad Y \right]$$

Condition: If rightmost morph is suffix, check for stress exclusion category

### Vowel Reduction Rule (p. 48)
$$\begin{bmatrix} /\varepsilon/ \\ /I/ \\ -\text{stress} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \bar{I} / X \quad Y$$

$$\begin{bmatrix} V \\ -\text{stress} \\ -\text{long} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \partial / X \quad Y$$

- Case 1: /E/ and /I/ reduce to /I-bar/
- Case 2: Other short non-stressed vowels reduce to schwa /a/

## Parameters Found

### Rule Set Composition (p. 51)
- **534 total rules** in first testing procedure:
  - 127 consonant rules
  - 46 prefix rules (40 prefixes)
  - 155 suffix rules (96 suffixes)
  - 206 vowel rules

### System Configuration
- Current system uses **413 rules**
- Maximal set: **557 rules**
- Minimal set: **277 rules**

## Rules/Algorithms

### Stress-Dependent /t/ and /d/ Rule (p. 48)
- /t/ becomes /ch/ (palatalized) if:
  - Not in initial consonant cluster AND
  - Precedes unstressed /u/ or /U/, OR
  - Precedes unstressed schwa which was /u/ or /U/ before stress rules
- /d/ becomes /j/ (palatalized) under same conditions
- Examples: perpetuity (/t/), perpetual (/ch/)

### Rule Format (Appendix, p. 61)
General form: `S1 > S2 / S3 <- S4`
- S1: letter string to convert
- S2: phoneme string result
- S3: left context
- S4: right context
- `/` (slash): one of four context markers

Context markers:
| Char | Left Context | Right Context |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| ]    | letter       | letter        |
| [    | phoneme      | letter        |
| )    | letter       | phoneme       |
| (    | phoneme      | phoneme       |

### Variable Categories (p. 65)
**Boundary variables:**
- $B: #, +
- $D: #, =

**Letter variables:**
- $W: A, E, I, O, U, Y, +A, +E, +I, +O, +U, +Y, LE#, RE#
- $F: I, E, Y, +I, +E, +Y
- $L: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, Z, X, +C, +D, +F, +H, +L, +M, +N, +P, +R, +S, +T, +W, +'S
- ... (extensive variable definitions)

**Phoneme variables:**
- $C: P, T, K, B, D, G, F, S, V, Z, M, N, L, R, W, J, H, ^T, ^D, ^S, 'Z, 'C, ^J, 'G
- $G: P, B, F, M
- $J: P, T, K, F, ^T, S, ^S, ^C, H
- ... (extensive phoneme class definitions)

### Suffix Types (p. 62)
- **P**: non-vocalic suffix (doesn't begin with vowel); [y] may change to [i]
- **E**: vocalic suffix (generally short); recognized before inflectional/consonantal suffixes
- **F**: regular suffix

Suffix codes encode:
- Right digit: possible parts of speech of preceding suffix
- Left digit: possible parts of speech of current suffix
- 3-digit: leftmost digit = 1 means suffix only at word end

### Example Suffix Entry
`F 166-ES`: Regular suffix, word-final only (1), forms nouns (4) and verbs (2), may follow nominal (4) or verbal (2) suffix

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The results of this study indicate that the letter-to-phoneme system is quite powerful, even in isolation. When considered in the domain of the overall text-to-speech system in which a lexicon is available for high-frequency words and compounds, the letter-to-phoneme system should be highly reliable." (p. 58)

> "Almost all problems in this category arise from the lack of a morph lexicon. Words are pronounced incorrectly because letter strings in a root which appear to be suffixes are converted to phonemes using rules for suffix pronunciation." (p. 57)

> "There are very high frequency words, said, should and would, which do not follow letter-to-sound rules." (p. 54)

## Implementation Notes

### For Qlatt TTS Frontend

1. **Rule Application Order** (critical for stress):
   - Main Stress Rule (cyclic)
   - Stressed Syllable Rule (cyclic)
   - Alternating Stress Rule (cyclic)
   - Strong First Syllable Rule (non-cyclic)
   - Destressing Rule (non-cyclic)
   - Compound Stress Rule (non-cyclic)
   - Vowel Reduction Rule (non-cyclic)

2. **Palatalization Rule** for /t/ and /d/:
   ```javascript
   // /t/ -> /ch/ before unstressed /u/, /U/, or reduced schwa from /u/
   // /d/ -> /j/ under same conditions
   // NOT in initial consonant cluster
   // Example: perpetuity vs perpetual
   ```

3. **Vowel Reduction Implementation**:
   - /E/ (epsilon) and /I/ reduce to /I-bar/ (barred-i)
   - All other short unstressed vowels reduce to schwa
   - Modification: /E/ and /I/ reduced to /I-bar/ rather than schwa

4. **High-Frequency Exception Words** requiring lexicon lookup:
   - said, should, would, could
   - two, do, to
   - break, steak
   - of, corps

5. **Suffix Recognition Priority** (right-to-left, longest match first):
   - -uous precedes -ous precedes -us precedes -s
   - Each suffix has syntactic compatibility code

6. **Prefix Recognition Priority** (left-to-right, longest match first):
   - extra precedes ex
   - uni precedes un

7. **The Complete Worked Example** (p. 49-50):
   ```
   MULTINUCLEOLATED -> m^ltinukli^letId

   Processing stages:
   1. Input: MULTINUCLEOLATED
   2. Morpheme parse: MULTI=NUCLEOL+ATE+ED
   3. Letter-to-phoneme: mAlti=nukliol+et+Id
   4. Main Stress Rule cycle 1 (domain: multi=nukliol): stress on 'i'
   5. Stressed Syllable Rule cycle 1
   6. Alternating Stress Rule cycle 1
   7. Main Stress Rule cycle 2 (domain: mAlti=nukliol+et)
   8. Stressed Syllable Rule cycle 2
   9. Alternating Stress Rule cycle 2
   10. Strong First Syllable Rule: assigns 2-stress to first syllable
   11. Destressing Rule: removes stress, shortens vowels
   12. Compound Stress Rule: primary (1) becomes secondary (2)
   13. Vowel Reduction: unstressed vowels -> schwa or I-bar
   14. Final: m^ltinukli^letId (stress: 2-1-2)
   ```

8. **Key Phoneme Symbol Mappings** (p. 64):
   | Rules Symbol | IPA | Description |
   |--------------|-----|-------------|
   | E | i | as in "beat" |
   | ^I | I | as in "bit" |
   | A | ey | as in "bait" |
   | ^E | E | as in "bet" |
   | "A | ae | as in "bat" |
   | 'A | a | as in "father" |
   | ^O | c (open o) | as in "bought" |
   | O | o | as in "boat" |
   | ^U | U | as in "put" |
   | U | u | as in "boot" |
   | Y | ^ | schwa, as in "but" |
   | ^S | S | as in "ship" |
   | ^Z | Z | as in "measure" |
   | ^C | tS | as in "church" |
   | ^J | dZ | as in "judge" |

9. **Accuracy Expectations**:
   - Expect ~67-72% acceptable pronunciation for general text
   - Medical/technical terms: ~53% without specialized prefixes
   - Adding medical prefixes would improve Stedman's accuracy by ~10%
