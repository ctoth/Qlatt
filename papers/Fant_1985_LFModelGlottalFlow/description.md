The LF-model defines glottal flow using four parameters (t_p, t_e, t_a, E_e) that continuously describe the glottal pulse from opening through closure and residual return phase, providing a unified mathematical formulation that eliminates discontinuities in earlier models. The model uniquely captures voice quality variations across modal, pressed, and breathy phonation types, with the return phase time constant (t_a) directly predicting spectral tilt through a simple first-order low-pass filter characteristic. This paper is essential for speech synthesis because it establishes the physical relationship between glottal parameters and perceptual voice qualities, providing both analytical equations and practical nomograms for implementing sophisticated voice source control in synthesizers like Klatt.
