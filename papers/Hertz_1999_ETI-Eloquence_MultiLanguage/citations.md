- **[4] Hertz (1990)** - Documents the Delta programming language itself, the core tool enabling rule-based text-to-speech development across languages.

- **[5] Hertz (1991)** - Describes the phone-and-transition model that segments spectrograms and aligns acoustic timing with phonological units; central to the timing model used in this paper.

- **[1] Beckman & Pierrehumbert (1986)** - Provides the intonational framework (tones and tiers) used for F0 contour generation across languages.

- **[2] Clements & Hertz (1995)** - Shows an integrated phonological and phonetic approach to deriving acoustic parameters from linguistic structure.
