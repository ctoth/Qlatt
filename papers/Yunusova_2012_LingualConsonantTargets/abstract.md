# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The study examined the positional targets for lingual consonants defined using a point-parameterized approach with Wave (NDI). The overall goal was to determine which consonants had unique tongue positions with respect to other consonants. Nineteen talkers repeated VCV syllables that included consonants /t, d, s, z, ʃ, ʧ, k, g/ in symmetrical vowel contexts /i, u, a/, embedded in a carrier phrase. Target regions for each consonant, characterized in terms of x,y,z tongue positions at the point of maximum tongue elevation, were extracted. Distances and overlaps were computed between all consonant pairs and compared to the distances and overlaps of their contextual targets. Cognates and postalveolar homorganics were found to share the location of their target regions. On average, alveolar stops showed distinctively different target regions than alveolar fricatives, which in turn showed different target region locations than the postalveolar consonants. Across talker variability in target locations was partially explained by differences in habitual speaking rate and hard palate characteristics.

## Our Interpretation

This study uses electromagnetic articulography to map tongue positioning for English consonants, finding that cognates (/d-t/, /s-z/, /k-g/) occupy identical target regions while alveolar stops differ significantly from alveolar fricatives. The work demonstrates that consonant articulatory targets are influenced by speaker anatomy (palate shape/width) and speaking rate, establishing empirical expectations for where consonants are produced relative to each other in the vocal tract—critical data for understanding coarticulation, speech motor control, and applications in speech recognition and clinical treatment of articulation disorders.
