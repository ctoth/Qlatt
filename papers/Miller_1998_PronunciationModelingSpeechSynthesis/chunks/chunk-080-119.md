## Key Findings

### Lexical Database (Lexorola)
- Relational database architecture with 4 tables: Variants, Orthography, Pronunciation, Properties
- Created from 3 source lexica:
  - Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary (Weide 1995)
  - Moby Pronunciator II (Ward 1996)
  - COMLEX English pronouncing lexicon (Pronlex, LDC 1995)
- Contains ~200,000 pronunciations
- Over 1,000 require disambiguation by part of speech
- Over 200 require disambiguation by sense

### Transcription Philosophy
- Lexical (phonemic) pronunciations stored in dictionary - appropriate for use in isolation
- Postlexical pronunciations generated by neural network module from lexical forms
- "Generalized American" dialect chosen as base - distinct from "General American" (Wells 1982)
- Preserved distinction between voiced /w/ and voiceless /M/ (which witch)
- Simplified phone set compared to source dictionaries

### Dictionary Quality Assessment
- Pronlex thought to be highest quality due to production method and transcription protocol (McLemore 1995)
- CMU pronunciations were partly generated by speech synthesizer
- Moby has pronunciations from several different sources, lacks consistency

### Labeled Speech Corpus
- 7,088 total words in corpus
- 90% training / 10% testing split
- University-educated male speaker from Chicago (aged 36-38)
- Labeled at narrow phonetic level similar to TIMIT (Seneff and Zue 1988)
- Uses CSLU labeling guidelines (Lander 1997)

### Labeling Scheme Tiers (Figure 3-1)
- Phonetic tier
- Words tier
- Syllables tier (primary/secondary stress)
- Phrase tier
- Clause tier
- Sentence tier
- Tones tier (ToBI conventions)
- Breaks tier (1-4 scale for disjuncture)

### Phonemicity vs. Allophony Decision Framework (Table 4-1)
Four conditions for handling allophony in TTS:
1. **Condition 1**: Phonemic dictionary + phonemic corpus - all allophony handled by acoustic NN
2. **Condition 2**: Phonemic dictionary + allophonic corpus - postlexical module converts (PREFERRED)
3. **Condition 3**: Allophonic dictionary + allophonic corpus - problematic for cross-word phenomena
4. **Condition 4**: Allophonic dictionary + phonemic corpus - unsatisfactory

### Acoustic Neural Network
- Generates 5ms frames of vocoder parameters
- Multi-layer architecture
- Uses TDNN window over 30 non-uniformly sampled frames over 415ms
- Inputs: phone label, prominence ranking, syllable stress, function/content specification
- Phone features supplement raw phone labels (Table 5-1 referenced)
- Output block 12 contains coder parameters

## Parameters/Rules Found

| Rule/Parameter | Description | Value/Pattern | Page |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|------|
| Schwa coloring | Unstressed /I/ with /schwa/ | Lexorola collapses to /schwa/ | 82 |
| Low back vowels | /open-o/ vs /a/ distribution | Inconsistent across dictionaries | 80 |
| RP-like distribution | Proposed for low back vowels | 'o' = /a/, 'augh','ough','aw','au' = /open-o/ | 80 |
| Syllable boundaries | Based on perceptual grounds | Merriam-Webster 9th edition style | 90 |
| Break indices | ToBI convention | 1-4 scale (4=max disjuncture) | 92-93 |
| TDNN window | Context for acoustic NN | 30 frames over 415ms | 103 |
| Frame rate | Acoustic output | 5ms per frame | 102 |

## Algorithms/Procedures

### Lexical Database Creation
1. Combine three source lexica (CMU, Moby, Pronlex)
2. Remove sociolinguistic variants in favor of "Generalized American"
3. Preserve minority distinctions that can derive merged dialects (e.g., which/witch)
4. Add part-of-speech and sense tags for non-homophonous homographs
5. Simplify transcription to more phonemic (less allophonic) representation
6. Develop consistency protocols based on McLemore (1995) and Schmidt et al. (1993)

### Speech Labeling Process
1. Phonetic labeling at narrow level similar to TIMIT
2. First pass: syntax-oriented (phrase, clause, sentence boundaries; function/content tags; prominence rankings)
3. Second pass: prosody-oriented (ToBI conventions - tones, breaks)

### Neural Network Processing
1. Input Block 1: TDNN window with prominence, stress, function/content, phone label
2. Input Block 2: Duration info for preceding/following 4 segments
3. Blocks 3-4: Phoneme-to-feature conversion
4. Blocks 5-8: Feature processing (15-15-15-10 outputs)
5. Block 9: Combination layer (60 outputs)
6. Block 10: Hidden layer (40 outputs)
7. Block 11: Output preparation (14 outputs)
8. Block 12: Coder parameters output

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "We distinguish this term from 'General American' which has been used by researchers to describe a dialect that they believe to be actually spoken by a segment of the community" (p. 73)

> "It is a truism in phonetics that no two utterances, even of the same word, are identical" (p. 97)

> "The TIMIT labels represent a necessarily-arbitrary segmentation and categorization of utterances into phonetic segments. Obviously, any study of these labels will be acceptable only to researchers who accept segmental phonetic transcriptions as a useful record of speech-events" (p. 89)

> "only in spontaneous speech will we find the most advanced tokens of linguistic change in progress" - Labov (1994, 158) (p. 87)

## Implementation Notes

### For Lexicon Design
- Keep dictionary phonemic, not allophonic - let postlexical module handle allophony
- Preserve contrasts that can derive merged dialects (superset approach)
- Tag non-homophonous homographs for POS and sense
- Use schwa for both stressed and unstressed central vowels (Ladefoged's recommendation)

### For Phone Set Design
- Lexorola uses fewer symbols than Pronlex/CMU
- Collapse syllabic nasals to schwa + nasal consonant
- Use single symbol for r-colored schwa
- Consider collapsing unstressed /I/ with /schwa/

### For Corpus Labeling
- Include stop closures ('c' suffix) and releases separately
- Label aspirated vs unaspirated voiceless stops
- Distinguish glottal stop from /t/ vs. intervocalic glottal stop
- ToBI break indices useful for phrase boundaries (3=intermediate, 4=intonational)

### For Neural Network
- 5ms frame rate standard for vocoder parameters
- TDNN window provides ~415ms of context
- Phone features help network learn similarities between phones
- Prominence ranking (0-13) based on part of speech
