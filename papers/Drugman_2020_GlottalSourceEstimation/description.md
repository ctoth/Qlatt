This paper systematically compares three state-of-the-art glottal source estimation techniques—closed-phase inverse filtering (CPIF), iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF), and complex cepstrum decomposition (CCD)—on both synthetic speech with known ground truth and real connected speech with varying voice qualities. The key findings show that CCD and CPIF perform best on clean speech signals while IAIF is most robust to noise, and that glottal parameters (particularly NAQ, H1-H2, and HRF) extracted by these methods can reliably discriminate between tensed, modal, and soft phonation types. For speech synthesis, this work validates which acoustic measures best characterize voice quality variations and provides guidance on selecting appropriate analysis methods for extracting glottal source targets from natural speech recordings.
