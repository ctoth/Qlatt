This paper demonstrates how articulatory constraints and coarticulation patterns drive sound changes in Romance languages, providing phonetic explanations for diphthong stability, velar palatalization, glide epenthesis, and consonant lenition. Recasens shows that many historically documented sound changes—previously attributed to perceptual factors—are better explained by the mechanical demands of tongue dorsum gestures, closure location, and gestural timing during speech production. For speech synthesis, this work is critical because it establishes predictable rules for coarticulation strength between glides and vowels, closure difficulty constraints for palatals, and allophonic glide insertion patterns that depend on the articulatory properties of adjacent segments.
