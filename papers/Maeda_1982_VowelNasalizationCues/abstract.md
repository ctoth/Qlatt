# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The manner in which vowel spectra are modified as the degree of the nasal coupling is varied was investigated by means of a simulation of the vocal-tract system. Connecting a side cavity, which represents the nasal sinuses, to the main nasal tract, speech synthesis by simulation could produce naturally sounding nasalized vowels. Such spectral variations were studied in detail to shed some light on acoustic cues for vowel nasalization. The advantage of the simulation approach is that the acoustic characteristics of the nasalized vowels can be calculated for arbitrary coupling magnitude, with a realistic vocal-tract model. The computed vocal-tract transfer functions were then converted to pseudo-auditory excitation patterns. A consistent effect of the coupling, for the 11 French vowels that were investigated, was a flattening of the excitation patterns, extending in the frequency range from 300 to 2500 Hz. Since those vowels with flattened spectra were actually heard as nasalized, it may be suggested that the principal cue for nasalization is spectral flattening in that wide frequency range.

## Our Interpretation

Maeda uses vocal-tract simulation to investigate how nasal coupling affects vowel spectra, modeling the nasal sinuses as a side cavity connected to the main vocal tract. The key finding is that nasalization produces spectral flattening in the 300-2500 Hz range, which serves as the primary acoustic cue for distinguishing nasalized from oral vowels. This work directly supports formant synthesis implementations that need realistic spectral modifications for nasal vowel production.
