This paper establishes the theoretical framework connecting LF model time-domain parameters to their frequency-domain spectral consequences, providing equations for both synthesis control and analysis through inverse filtering. The key contribution is identifying Fa = 1/(2πTa) as the primary spectral tilt control parameter, showing that the return phase acts as a first-order low-pass filter on the source spectrum, with typical values ranging from 100 Hz (breathy) to 3000 Hz (pressed). This work is foundational for understanding how LF parameters affect voice quality in formant synthesis, and the quantitative male/female comparisons (showing remarkably constant Uo/Ee ratios despite different absolute values) provide practical guidance for parameter rules in systems like Qlatt.
