# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The pattern of durations of individual phonetic segments and pauses conveys information about the linguistic content of an utterance. Acoustic measures of segmental timing have been used by many investigators to determine the variables that influence the durational structure of a sentence. The literature on segmental duration is reviewed and related to perceptual data on the discrimination of duration and to psychophysical data on the ability of listeners to make linguistic decisions on the basis of durational cues alone. We conclude that, in English, duration often serves as a primary perceptual cue in the distinctions between (1) inherently long versus short vowels, (2) voiced versus voiceless fricatives, (3) phrase-final versus non-final syllables, (4) voiced versus voiceless postvocalic consonants, as indicated by changes to the duration of the preceding vowel in phrase-final positions, (5) stressed versus unstressed or reduced vowels, and (6) the presence or absence of emphasis.

## Our Interpretation

This paper reviews how segmental duration patterns in English speech convey linguistic information, establishing quantitative rules for predicting durations in synthesis and analyzing which durational cues are perceptually important. The key contribution is an incompressibility formula showing that segments cannot be shortened below a minimum floor (approximately 42-45% of inherent duration), with a 9-parameter model accounting for 97% of durational variance across 56 contextual conditions. For speech synthesis, this work is essential because duration is a primary cue for distinguishing vowel quality, fricative voicing, phrasal stress patterns, and sentence structure, with changes exceeding the just-noticeable difference of approximately 25 milliseconds being perceptually significant.
