## Key Findings

### Voice Onset Time (VOT)

- **Voicing decision cannot be made on VOT alone** - perceptual experiments confirm this (Klatt 1975)
- Some derivative of VOT (rapid spectral changes at voicing onset) or a priori phonetic knowledge may help distinguish voiced/voiceless stops
- VOT increases from /b/ to /d/ to /g/ due to articulator position and constriction shape
- /b/ constriction (lips) can move away rapidly after release - results in short burst
- /g/ constriction (tongue body) is massive and cannot move away quickly - maintains narrow opening longer, generating turbulence noise for longer period

### VOT Measurements - Singleton Voiced Stops

- Mean VOT for voiced stops: approximately 20 msec
- /b/: ~17 msec
- /d/: ~23 msec
- /g/: ~38 msec (longest)
- No consistent dependency of VOT on following vowel found across all three stops
- Some sensitivity to vowel context: VOT for /g/ preceding back vowels among the longest

### VOT Measurements - Singleton Voiceless Stops (Figure 4.4)

- Mean VOT: 67.5 msec
- /p/: 58.4 msec (9 msec shorter than mean)
- /t/: 70.8 msec (7 msec for standard deviation)
- /k/: 73.2 msec (7 msec longer than mean, 11 msec standard deviation)
- Frication duration: ~15 msec on average (longer than voiced stops)
- Aspiration durations approximately equal for all three stops
- No systematic variation of VOT as function of high/low vowel

### Total Duration - Voiceless Aspirated Stops (Figure 4.5)

- Total duration measured from beginning of silence to voicing onset
- /p/ and /t/: 150 msec
- /k/: 148 msec
- Closure interval is longest for /p/ and shortest for /k/ (inverse of VOT relationship)

### VOT in Clusters

- 21 word-initial consonant clusters studied (Table 4.I)
- 14 are 2-element stop-sonorant clusters
- Remaining are /s/-stop or /s/-stop-sonorant combinations

**Voiced stops in stop-sonorant clusters (Figure 4.7):**
- Mean VOT: 26.3 msec (5.7 msec or 28% increase from isolation)
- Increase greatest for dentals: 7 msec (37%)

**Voiceless stops in stop-sonorant clusters (Figure 4.8):**
- Mean VOT: 85.6 msec (18.1 msec or 27% increase over singleton)
- Dentals show greatest increase: 28.4 msec (40%)

**VOT as function of following sonorant (Figure 4.9):**
- Mean VOT varies from 15 msec for /bl/ to 100 msec for /tw/
- Increase ranges from 1.5 msec for /gl/ to 29.3 msec for /tw/

**Stops in /s/-clusters (Figure 4.10):**
- VOT decreases sharply for voiceless stops in s-clusters
- Mean VOT in s-clusters preceding vowel: 22.7 msec (just slightly higher than voiced stops in isolation)
- When stops appear in s-cluster preceding sonorant: mean VOT = 30 msec

### Glottal Timing Model (Figure 4.11)

- Schematized relationship between glottal spreading and supraglottal opening
- Stop release timing controlled by two mechanisms: supraglottal release and glottal abduction
- Constant total duration explained by independence of glottal timing from supraglottal movement
- Release adjusted according to articulators so that transition is complete by voicing onset
- Lack of rapid spectral change at voicing onset necessary for proper perception of voiceless stops (Stevens and Klatt 1974)

### VOT Discussion Summary

- VOT data spans wide range even in controlled environment
- Averaged VOT for voiced stops: 13 msec (/b/) to 38 msec (/gw/)
- Averaged VOT for voiceless unaspirated stops: 15 msec (/sp/) to 36.7 msec (/str/)
- Averaged VOT for voiceless aspirated stops: 58.4 msec (/p/) to 100 msec (/tw/)
- 22% or 16% overlap between voiced and voiceless stops possible
- 13% of singleton /g/'s have VOT >= 40 msec

### Table 5.I: Overall RMS Amplitude of Burst for Singleton Stops (page 113)

| Stop | Overall RMS Amplitude (in dB) |
|------|------------------------------|
| /p/  | -27.6                        |
| /t/  | -16.6                        |
| /k/  | -17.2                        |
| /b/  | -28.0                        |
| /d/  | -15.8                        |
| /g/  | -16.6                        |

**Key findings from Table 5.I:**
- No significant difference in RMS amplitude between voiced and voiceless stops
- Dentals and velars have about the same RMS amplitude
- Labial bursts are weaker by about **12 dB**

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesis - VOT Parameters

1. **Voiced stops default VOT values:**
   - /b/: 17 ms
   - /d/: 23 ms
   - /g/: 38 ms

2. **Voiceless aspirated stops default VOT values:**
   - /p/: 58 ms (frication ~15ms + aspiration ~43ms)
   - /t/: 71 ms (frication ~15ms + aspiration ~56ms)
   - /k/: 73 ms (frication ~15ms + aspiration ~58ms)

3. **In clusters, increase VOT by:**
   - ~28% for stop-sonorant clusters
   - But reduce to ~23 ms for /s/-stop clusters (voiceless unaspirated pattern)

### For Klatt Synthesis - Burst Amplitude (AF parameter)

1. **Labial bursts (/p/, /b/) are 12 dB weaker** than dentals/velars
2. Suggested relative amplitudes:
   - /p/, /b/: -28 dB (relative to vowel peak)
   - /t/, /d/: -16 dB
   - /k/, /g/: -17 dB

### For Klatt Synthesis - Burst Frequency

1. **Dental stops (/t/, /d/):**
   - Broad-band, high-frequency burst (above 2000-3000 Hz)
   - Mean ~3,660 Hz for /t/, ~3,300 Hz for /d/
   - Lower frequency (~3,300 Hz) before rounded/retroflexed vowels

2. **Velar stops (/k/, /g/):**
   - Burst frequency highly dependent on vowel context
   - Before front vowels: ~2,700 Hz (compact, mid-frequency)
   - Before back unrounded: ~1,770 Hz
   - Before back rounded: ~1,250 Hz (lowest)
   - Secondary peak always present for back /k/'s (3/4-wavelength resonance of front cavity)
   - Including this secondary peak improves synthetic /k/ quality (Klatt, personal communication)

3. **Labial stops (/p/, /b/):**
   - Wide range of burst frequency values
   - No distinct spectral peak - spectra show no clear burst frequency
   - RMS amplitudes weak - these stops are often omitted from burst frequency analysis

### Glottal Timing Implementation

The constant total duration (~150 ms) for voiceless stops suggests:
- Glottal spreading/closing is independent of oral articulator timing
- Oral release timing adjusts to ensure transition complete by voicing onset
- For synthesis: closure duration should be inversely related to VOT (longer closure for /p/, shorter for /k/)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Our data reaffirm the finding by Klatt [Klatt 1975] that the perceptual decision on the voicing feature for English stops can not be made on the basis of VOT alone." (page 096)

> "The increase of VOT from /b/ to /d/ to /g/ can be explained by the position and shape of the oral constriction as well as the articulators involved in forming the constriction [Klatt, 1975]. The constriction for /b/ is formed at the lips, which can move away quite rapidly following the release. As mentioned earlier, the labial release is usually weak in intensity, which also contributes to the appearance of a short burst." (page 096)

> "The constriction for /g/ is formed by the tongue body, which is rather massive and can not move away from the palate too rapidly following the release. It has also been observed [Houde 1967, Perkell 1969] that the motion of the tongue body after the release is in such a way that a tapered, narrow opening is maintained for a longer period of time. Therefore the constriction for /g/ opens slowly, allowing turbulence noise to be generated for a longer period of time." (pages 096-097)

> "This lack of rapid spectral change at the onset of voicing is necessary for the proper perception of the voiceless stops, as suggested by Stevens and Klatt [Stevens and Klatt 1974]." (page 099)

> "The burst duration for the voiceless aspirated stops is, on the average, 15 msec longer than the voiced stops. Aspiration durations for the three stops are approximately equal, thus leaving the burst durations for the three voiceless stops with the same relationship as described previously." (page 091)

> "The closure interval is longest for /p/ and shortest for /k/. In fact, as shown in Figure 4.5, where closure as well as voicing onset durations are included, the total duration of these stops, measured from the beginning of silence to the first onset of voicing, was found to be practically identical. The total durations for /p/ and /t/ are 150 msec, whereas the total duration for /k/ was found to be 148 msec." (page 091)

> "The /t/ bursts are, in general, rather broad-band and occupy primarily the high-frequency region of the spectrum, say, above 2,000 Hz. The /k/ bursts show remarkably dissimilar shapes depending on the nature of the following vowel. The burst of a /k/ preceding a front vowel has a more compact spectral shape than the /t/ burst, and the location of the burst is in the mid-frequency region." (page 111)

> "Inclusion of this additional peak has been shown to improve the quality of synthetic /k/'s [Klatt, personal communication]." (page 111)

> "The data in Table 5.I indicate that there is no significant difference in RMS amplitude between voiced and voiceless stops. Dentals and velars have about the same RMS amplitude, whereas the labial bursts are weaker, by about 12 dB." (page 112)
