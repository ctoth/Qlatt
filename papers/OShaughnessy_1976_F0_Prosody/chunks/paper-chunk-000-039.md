## Key Findings

### Three Functions of Language (Halliday 1970a)
1. **Ideational function** - conveys propositional/objective content (nouns and verbs)
2. **Interpersonal function** - establishes social relations, speaker's attitude toward content
3. **Textual function** - links with context, structures discourse, delimits message units

### Three Functions of Fo in Speech
1. **Phonemically** - distinguishes syllable-initial voiced/unvoiced consonants
2. **Lexically** - distinguishes words with same phonemic composition (e.g., noun-verb pairs like "import-import")
3. **Syntactically** - delimits and segments utterances into smaller units
4. **Semantically** - highlights important words, marks new vs old information

### Suprasegmentals
- Five categories: intonation, rhythm, loudness, stress, voice quality
- First 4 are important for linguistic meaning; voice quality signals speaker emotion
- Acoustically represented by: fundamental frequency (Fo), duration, and intensity
- Fo ranked above duration and intensity for stress and intonation purposes (Fry, 1955; 1958)

### Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP)
- Sentence analyzed into: **theme**, **transition**, **rheme**
- **Rheme** = greatest "new information" (Communicative Dynamism)
- **Theme** = least new information (old/given)
- Theme tends to occur early in sentence, rheme late
- "New information" words receive Fo accent-marking
- Thematic elements are unstressed; rhematic elements carry higher degrees of CD and are prosodically heaviest

### Fo Accent
- Fo movement for emphasis is denoted as "Fo accent"
- Occurs on lexically-stressed syllable of a word
- New information words tend to receive Fo accent-marking
- "Fo accent" = accent on the lexically-stressed syllable leading to word being perceived as 'stressed'

## Parameters Found

| Name | Symbol | Value | Units | Context |
|------|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Pitch discrimination threshold | JND | 3 | Hz | Two tones distinguishable |
| Semitone | - | 12 semitones = 1 tone | - | Logarithmic Fo measure (doubling of Fo) |
| Pitch rise discrimination | JND | 1.5 | semitones | Median for rises |
| Pitch fall discrimination | JND | 3.0 | semitones | Median for falls (half as accurate as rises) |
| JND for Fo change (steady vowel) | - | 0.3-0.5 | Hz | Constant Fo synthetic vowel |
| JND for linear ramp Fo | - | 2.0-2.5 | Hz | Linear ramp Fo contour |
| JND for rate-of-change (slope near zero) | - | 12 | Hz/sec | Rate of change discrimination |
| JND for rate-of-change (slope -120 Hz/sec) | - | 32 | Hz/sec | Descending contour |
| Smoothing threshold | - | 5 | csec (centiseconds) | Fo variations < 5 csec should be averaged out |
| Quantization threshold | - | 5 | cps (Hz) | Variations < 5 cps should be levelled out |
| Minimum duration for pitch contrast | - | 0.09 | sec | Below this, syllable perceived as unpitched |
| Intonation discrimination interval | - | 6 | cps | Region of a semitone |

## Rules/Algorithms

### Fo Smoothing Rule (Witting 1962)
1. Fo variations in voiced segments < 5 csec (50 ms) duration should be averaged out as simple levels
2. Fo variations < 5 cps should be levelled out
3. This approximates normal pitch perception in speech

### Perceptually-Relevant Fo Primitives (Klatt 1973)
Three dimensions of perceptual oppositions:
1. Average Fo: high, mid, or low
2. Fo direction: rising, falling, or steady
3. Fo rate of change: fast or slow

### Stress Realization Rules
1. Fo step changes have "all or none effect" - syllable on higher side judged as stressed
2. Continuous Fo changes: the Fo cue outweighs all other cues (duration, intensity)
3. Fo is a dominant cue in stress perception, but trades with duration and amplitude
4. 96% of stressed syllables accompanied by Fo variations regarded as perceptible (Bleakley)
5. 93% of perceptible Fo variations consist of Fo rise or rise+fall

### Pitch Perception Rules
1. Listeners perceive in terms of limited set of recognizable patterns, not 1:1 with voice periodicity
2. Listeners interpolate/extrapolate pitch through unvoiced regions
3. Short glides (< 0.09 sec) tend to be missed perceptually
4. Discrimination of falls is about half as accurate as rises
5. Straight-line approximations of Fo contours do not affect intonation identification

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Syntactically, Fo can be used to segment and delimit portions of utterances into phrasal units, to mark sentences as yes/no questions, and to mark the end of an utterance versus a pause in the utterance. Phrasal units start with Fo rises and often end with Fo falls, but the ends of non-final units frequently have small Fo rises, as opposed to sharper falls at the end of an utterance." (page 2)

> "Semantically, Fo can be used to highlight and emphasize those words in each utterance that the speaker deems important to the message. Essentially, the words least predictable from context receive the heaviest Fo marking or 'accent.' Certain 'inherently contrastive' word classes were found to have heavier accent than others, and certain syntactic transformations had 'focus' effects in that they shifted accent." (page 2-3)

> "Phonetically, Fo was found to form a global pattern upon which accent rises and falls were superimposed. Accents were viewed as Fo obtrusions above a declining baseline. The sizes of these accents were related to the number present in each utterance, and to the proximity of accents to each other." (page 3)

> "A relatively high Fo carries more 'weight' in a linguistic sense than a long duration or a high amplitude." (page 17)

> "The perceptually-relevant aspects of Fo are likely to be the broad Fo variations, which are most easily perceived by a listener. Features of the type: rise-level-or-fall, fast-or-slow change, and high-or-low, are the Fo primitives used in the analysis of this thesis because they appear to be controllable by the speaker and perceivable by the listener." (page 34)

> "Fo is a dominant parameter used by English speakers to denote stress, but that other parameters [e.g., duration] may be utilized." (page 39)

> "The chief acoustic cue to stress is the pitch change" (Mattingly, 1968:170) (page 40)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody System

1. **Smoothing**: Can smooth Fo contours - period-to-period fine structure can be removed with little discrimination loss. Voiced segments < 50ms can have their Fo averaged.

2. **Quantization**: Fo variations < 5 Hz (5 cps) can be levelled out without perceptual impact.

3. **Fo Primitives to Implement**:
   - Level (high/mid/low relative to speaker's range)
   - Direction (rising/falling/steady)
   - Rate (fast/slow change)

4. **Accent Placement**:
   - New information words get Fo accents
   - Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) are more likely to be accented
   - Function words (articles, pronouns, prepositions) typically unaccented
   - First occurrence of a word gets accent; repetitions are de-accented

5. **Stress Acoustic Correlates** (in order of importance):
   - Fo change (primary cue)
   - Duration (secondary)
   - Intensity/amplitude (tertiary)
   - All three used together in 99% of cases with at least 2 factors

6. **Rise vs Fall Asymmetry**:
   - Rises are more perceptually salient than falls
   - JND for rises: 1.5 semitones
   - JND for falls: 3.0 semitones
   - Fo rises more important perceptually than falls

7. **Declination**: Global pattern has declining baseline with accent obtrusions superimposed above it.

8. **Phrase Boundaries**:
   - Phrasal units start with Fo rises
   - Non-final units end with small Fo rises (continuation rises)
   - Final units end with sharper falls

9. **Question Intonation**:
   - Yes/no questions marked by terminal Fo pattern
   - Statement pattern (Tune A) vs question pattern (Tune B)
