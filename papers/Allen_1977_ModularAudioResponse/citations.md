**Note:** Allen (1977) appears to be an early systems paper establishing modular architecture principles for text-to-speech. The paper is self-contained and represents novel system design contributions rather than building upon cited foundations.

**System Components Discussed (for reference):**
- Linguistic analysis modules (FORMAT, DECOMP, PARSER, SOUND1, SOUND2)
- Prosody module (PROSE - fundamental frequency, duration, stress)
- Speech synthesis module (SYNTHS - parametric speech synthesis)
- Output module (SPEAK)
- Special hardware implementations (vocal tract model processor, parameter generator)
