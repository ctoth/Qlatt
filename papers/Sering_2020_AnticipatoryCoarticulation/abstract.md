# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The aim of the present study is to test whether effects of anticipatory coarticulation emerge from a segment based and a recurrent gradient based planning speech resynthesis in the articulatory speech synthesizer VocalTractLab. For this, natural articulations of /baba/, /babi/ and /babu/ are recorded using ultrasound. While anticipatory coarticulation is observable in the articulatory movements and the phonetic signal of the human recording, these patterns are not observable in the segment based resynthesis, and partially observed in the recurrent gradient based planning resynthesis. The recurrent gradient based planning shows anticipatory coarticulation in formant shifts, but not in tongue raising.

## Our Interpretation

This paper compares how two different speech synthesis approaches (segment-based and recurrent gradient-based planning) handle anticipatory coarticulation—the phenomenon where speakers adjust their articulatory movements in anticipation of upcoming sounds. The study uses ultrasound recordings and formant analysis to show that while recurrent gradient-based planning captures some coarticulation effects in formant shifts, neither approach fully reproduces human patterns, particularly in tongue raising. This is directly relevant to formant synthesizers like Klatt systems, as it highlights the challenge of automatically modeling coarticulation in rule-based or data-driven synthesis frameworks.
