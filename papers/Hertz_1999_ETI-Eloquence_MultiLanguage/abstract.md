# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

ETI-Eloquence is a multi-voice, multi-language, rule-based text-to-speech system based on the innovative Delta synthesis technology [4, 6, 8]. In the last three years, the system has been extended from General American English to nine new languages and dialects, including British English, Mexican and Castilian Spanish, Canadian and Parisian French, Mandarin Chinese, German, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese. One of the goals of this work has been to develop a universal strategy for text-to-speech rule development and as large a common rule base as possible. This paper describes the result of this work, providing an overview of the language-universal and language-specific components underlying our current rule system.

## Our Interpretation

ETI-Eloquence demonstrates how to build a unified TTS architecture that separates language-universal rules from language-specific rules, using the Delta system's multi-tiered utterance representation. The system extends a formant synthesizer across nine languages by leveraging common phonological and phonetic principles while accommodating language-specific variations in text normalization, phrase prediction, and acoustic parameter generation. This work is foundational for understanding how to structure reusable TTS rule systems that balance generalization with linguistic specificity.
