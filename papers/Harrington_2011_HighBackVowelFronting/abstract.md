# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Recent acoustic studies have provided evidence that /u/ (GOOSE) and /ʊ/ (FOOT) have fronted in the standard accent of England in the last fifty years, but what is less clear is whether this fronting is due entirely to a repositioning of the tongue or whether it has been accompanied by an unrounding of the lips. Four experiments were carried out to shed light on this issue. An acoustic study of anticipatory coarticulation in /s/ in the first of these suggested a similar degree of lip-protrusion for young speakers whose F2 of /u/ was raised compared with that of older speakers. Compatibly, judgments of lip-rounding elicited from cross-dubbed auditory-visual stimuli and an analysis of lip movement showed young speakers' /u/ to be produced with rounded lips. Their tongue positions and movements in the final experiment were found to be almost as advanced for /u/ as for /i/ (FLEECE) and nearer to a central position for lax /ʊ/ (FOOT). Taken together, these results confirm firstly, that the diachronic shift in /u/ has involved a realignment of the tongue, but not of the lips; and secondly, that the diachronic shift in /ʊ/ is likely to be a more recent innovation than that of its tense counterpart.

## Our Interpretation

This paper demonstrates that the dramatic fronting of high back vowels in modern Standard Southern British English (SSBE) results entirely from tongue advancement toward the front of the mouth, with no loss of lip rounding. Using four complementary experiments—acoustic analysis of coarticulation, cross-dubbed audio-visual perception testing, physiological measurements of lip movement, and EMA tracking of tongue position—the authors prove that young SSBE speakers maintain full lip rounding while positioning the tongue almost as far forward as for /i/, making F2-raising due to tongue movement rather than articulatory unrounding. For speech synthesis, this establishes critical formant targets for fronted SSBE /u/ (F2 around 2050-2250 Hz) while maintaining the acoustic consequences of rounded lips, and shows that the currently ongoing fronting of /ʊ/ began more recently than /u/-fronting.
