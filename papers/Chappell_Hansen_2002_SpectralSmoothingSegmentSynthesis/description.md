This paper systematically compares four spectral smoothing algorithms (optimal coupling, waveform interpolation, LP techniques, and psychoacoustic closure) for reducing discontinuities at segment boundaries in concatenative speech synthesis. Key findings include that optimal coupling most consistently improves quality (MOS 3.82 vs 3.53 raw), LP techniques work best for voiced-to-voiced transitions, and closure works best for stop/fricative transitions, demonstrating that no single algorithm succeeds universally. The work is highly relevant for Klatt synthesis coarticulation since formant transition smoothing strategies, JND values for perceptual thresholds, and typical transition durations (20-40 ms) directly inform frame-by-frame parameter interpolation and rule-based coarticulation modeling.
