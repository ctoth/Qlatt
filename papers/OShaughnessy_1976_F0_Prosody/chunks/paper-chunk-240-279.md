## Key Findings

### F0 Breaks at Syntactic Boundaries

F0 breaks (consisting of fall-rise patterns, silence pauses, and CRs) mark major syntactic boundaries. The size of F0 gestures and pause length depend on "strength" of the boundary in surface structure:

- Boundaries higher in surface structure tree = larger breaks
- Virtually every non-final clause (embedded and conjoined) was marked by an F0 break
- A period of silence + CR was part of breaks, except with dependent embedded clauses (NP-modifying clauses) where silence was often missing

### Conditions for Large F0 Falls Within a Clause

A large F0 occurs within a clause:
1. If the syntactic constituent is long enough (contains at least 2 content words)
2. If the boundary between adjacent syntactic constituents is ambiguous (could be before or after a given element)
3. If the syntactic boundary has been created by a syntactic transformation

### Two Types of Accent (Bolinger)

- **Accent A**: Marked by a sharp drop in pitch after the stressed syllable (used as "cut-off" with phrases syntactically/logically separate)
- **Accent B**: Marked by a jump to higher pitch on the accented syllable with no sharp drop afterward (suggests connectedness/incompleteness)

### Disjuncture Cues for Syntactic Disambiguation

Three parameters of speech available as cues for phrase structure:
1. F0 contour
2. Relative peak amplitude
3. Duration

Example: "the good flies quickly passed" vs "the good flies quickly past" - F0 fell sharply (-46 descent) on "flies" in #1 showing syntactic coherence, while -69 fall on "good" marked end of subject in #2.

### P-units (Phonological Units)

P-units are sets of words grouped by F0 that align with major syntactic constituents. Key characteristics:

- **F0 shape**: Rise + relatively level + fall movements (initial rise and final fall on exterior ASs)
- **Pattern**: "Very-slowly-falling" between initial rise and final fall
- **Hat pattern**: Sharp F0 rise, gradual falling stretch, sharp F0 drop (Maeda's "phonetic group")
- First and last accent positions are "comparatively conspicuous" providing "two information points"

### P-unit F0 Patterns by Position

| Position | Pattern (avg) | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Utterance-final | (+4, +9, -10) from 126 Hz | Sharp fall to below BOR |
| Phrase-final | (-8, +6, -12) from 148 Hz | Fall rapidly but not below BOR, then CR |
| Within-phrase | (+3, +16, -3) from 149 Hz | Slow fall, stays above BOR |

### Medial Unstressed Syllables (USs) Fall-off Rates

Within P-units, medial USs have slow fall-off rates:
- Average: -4 to -6 Hz/syllable
- After 1 word in clause: -12 fall-off from 164 Hz
- After 2 words: -11 and -10 per US from 149 Hz
- After 3-5 words: -12 from 117 Hz level
- After 5-8 words: F0 at BOR, may rise +9

### Multi-syllabic Accented Words - F0 Patterns by Position

| Position | Peak Pattern | Fall Pattern |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Utterance-final (92 cases) | 126 (-19, -11) | Sharp fall below BOR |
| Phrase-final (56 cases) | 148 (-8, +6, -12) | CR at end |
| Within-phrase (42 cases) | 149 (+3, +16, -3) | Slow fall, stays high |

### Monosyllabic Accented Words

Monosyllabic words contain accent gestures within single syllables, necessitating more than a simple rise or fall:
- Unvoiced words had higher peaks and larger prior jumps than voiced words
- Unvoiced initial consonant correlated with ~2:1 F0 rise ratio vs 1:2 for voiced
- Words starting utterances had peaks +19 higher than non-initial clauses, which were +16 higher than clause-internal phrases

### Voicing Effect on F0

An unvoiced initial consonant in an accented syllable (AS) correlated with:
- Prior F0 jump larger than ensuing vowel F0 rise
- ~2:1 ratio for unvoiced vs ~1:2 for voiced cases
- Exception: words like "big" and "dig" where short lax vowel lies between 2 obstruents

### Conjunction Effects on F0

Different conjunctions affect F0 patterns:
- "but"/"yet" rather than "and" led to increased accents on conjoined words
- "not" in co-ordinated phrases inserted an F0 break
- "and not" led to larger F0 breaks than "but not"

### Carrier and Anticipation Effects

- **Carrier effect**: Fo level in first clause higher than second (positional)
- **Anticipation effect**: AS tends to have more accent if more ASs follow (looking ahead)
- Competition effect: With more ASs, each gets less accent

### Information Load and Accent

Information load affects F0 patterns:
- New/contrastive items receive more accent (Accent A)
- Resumptive items receive less accent
- Indirect objects have less accent than direct objects in similar sentence positions
- When indirect object names specific person and direct object is indefinite, indirect object gets more accent

## Parameters Found

| Name | Symbol | Value | Units | Context |
|------|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| BOR (Bottom of Range) | - | ~95-105 | Hz | Female speaker baseline |
| Typical medial US fall-off | - | -4 to -6 | Hz/syllable | Within P-units |
| Fall accent (utterance-final) | - | -30 to -38 | Hz | Sharp fall on final AS |
| Rise accent | - | +17 to +35 | Hz | Initial AS of P-unit |
| CR (Continuation Rise) | - | +7 to +19 | Hz | At phrase boundaries |
| Overshoot | - | +11 to +15 | Hz | Into following US |
| P-unit initial level | - | 126-149 | Hz | Varies by position |
| Function word F0 range | - | 95-151 | Hz | Prior to P-units |
| Function word F0 at end | - | 102-115 | Hz | Convergence toward BOR |

## Rules/Algorithms

### P-unit F0 Generation Rule

1. Start P-unit with sharp rise accent on first AS
2. Maintain relatively level F0 through medial USs (slow -4 to -6 Hz/syllable fall)
3. End with sharp fall accent on final AS
4. If utterance-final: fall below BOR
5. If phrase-final: fall rapidly but add CR (+7 to +19 Hz)
6. If within-phrase: slow fall, stay above BOR

### Disambiguation via F0

1. Locate syntactic boundaries by placing sharp F0 falls
2. Larger falls for stronger boundaries
3. NP-VP boundary: less marked than clause boundaries
4. Subject-predicate boundary in simple sentences: often unmarked
5. In complex sentences: clause boundaries marked with breaks

### Function Word F0 Behavior

1. Function words outside P-units: F0 aims toward ~105 Hz level
2. After 1-word subject: F0 at 151 Hz, falls -36 on ensuing US
3. After 2 words: F0 at 131 Hz, falls -23
4. After 3-5 words: F0 falls to BOR (~95 level)
5. After 5-8 words: F0 at BOR, may rise +9 (not a true accent)
6. Function words within P-units: exhibit slow fall-off

### Accent Distribution in Parallel Structures

1. First occurrence of repeated word gets full accent
2. Second occurrence gets reduced accent
3. Contrasted/new elements get enhanced accent (+11 Hz average)
4. Identical elements in parallel positions get reduced accent

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "Fo patterns of many utterances can be described as containing sub-patterns called 'P-units,' in which the first AS had a sharp rise and the final AS had a sharp fall. Fo within a P-unit fell at a relatively slow rate, with Fo remaining above the BOR." (page 280)

> "Maeda has assigned the term 'phonetic group' to 'a group of words chunked by the combination of' a sharp Fo rise, a stretch of gradually falling Fo, and then a sharp Fo drop. This is the 'hat pattern.'" (page 254)

> "Hultzen's notion that, in a sentence, 'the first and last accent positions are comparatively conspicuous,' providing 'for two information points.'" (page 255)

> "The speaker's choice of whether to use a P-unit on a particular syntactic phrase depends not only on a close surface structure relationship among the words in the phrase, but also on whether the elements to be grouped form a 'cohesive' unit in some semantic sense." (page 270)

> "Fo contour, the relative peak amplitude, and duration are 'three parameters of speech available as cues for phrase structure.'" (page 244)

## Implementation Notes

### For TTS Prosody System

1. **P-unit detection**: Group words into P-units based on syntactic constituency. Each major syntactic phrase (NP, VP, PP) typically forms one P-unit.

2. **F0 contour generation for P-units**:
   - Initial AS: sharp rise (+17 to +35 Hz above baseline)
   - Medial syllables: gradual decline (-4 to -6 Hz/syllable)
   - Final AS: sharp fall (-30 to -38 Hz)
   - Add overshoot (+11-15 Hz) into initial US when next AS follows in same word

3. **Position-dependent modifications**:
   - Utterance-final: fall below BOR (to ~93 Hz for female)
   - Phrase-final: fall + CR (+7-19 Hz rise)
   - Within-phrase: stay above BOR

4. **Function words**:
   - Outside P-units: aim toward ~105 Hz
   - Within P-units: follow gradual decline

5. **Voicing effects**:
   - Unvoiced initial consonant: larger prior jump, smaller following rise
   - Voiced initial: smaller jump, larger rise

6. **Information structure**:
   - New/contrastive: +11 Hz accent boost
   - Given/repeated: reduce accent
   - Parallel structures: de-accent repeated elements

7. **Clause boundaries**: Insert F0 breaks (fall + optional pause + CR) at clause boundaries, with break size proportional to boundary strength in syntax tree.
