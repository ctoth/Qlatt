# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

In this paper, the formant transitions in vowel + stop consonant + vowel utterances spoken by Swedish, American, and Russian talkers are studied spectrographically. The data suggest a physiological model in terms of which the VCV articulations are represented by a basic diphthongal gesture with an independent stop-consonant gesture superimposed on its transitional portion. This interpretation necessitates a reevaluation of the locus theory proposed by the workers of the Haskins Laboratories. Some conclusions about the general nature of the neural instructions behind the VCV gestures are discussed.

## Our Interpretation

This paper presents a comprehensive spectrographic study of how vowels influence the acoustic transitions of stop consonants in VCV sequences, challenging the classical "locus theory" that assumed fixed frequency targets for consonants. The key finding is that formant transitions depend on the entire vowel context—not just the consonant itself—suggesting that consonant and vowel gestures overlap and interact during speech production. This work is crucial for speech synthesis because it demonstrates that static locus frequencies cannot generate natural-sounding stop consonants; instead, synthesis systems must model dynamic coarticulation as a physiologically-grounded interaction between overlapping articulatory commands.
