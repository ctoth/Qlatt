This paper proposes a hybrid HMM-based speech synthesis system that combines phone-level HMMs for spectral modeling with syllable-level HMMs for prosody, addressing the fundamental trade-off where phones poorly capture pitch contours while syllables suffer from data sparsity. The key contributions include a named segment clustering scheme for syllables using linguistic features (stress, accent, position, onset/coda voicing, POS), a Levenshtein distance back-off strategy for handling missing units at synthesis time, and dynamic time warping to align phone spectral features with syllable-based prosodic timing. The hybrid system demonstrates superior F0 prediction (RMSE 23.06 vs 24.82 Hz for English, correlation 0.87 vs 0.78) with modest subjective improvements (MOS 4.3 vs 4.2), showing that syllable-level modeling is essential for capturing natural prosodic variation in statistical parametric synthesis.
