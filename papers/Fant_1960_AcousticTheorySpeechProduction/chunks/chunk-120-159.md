## Key Concepts

### Formant-Cavity Relationships (pp. 121-124)
- **First formant (F1)**: Generally dependent more on back cavity volume than other cavities
  - Exception: vowel [a] where F1 affected equally by front and back cavity changes
  - Back cavity of [a] is shorter than front cavity, so unit length removal has larger effect
- **Second formant (F2)**:
  - For [i]: essentially determined by mouth cavity and narrowest section
  - For [u]: tuned by lip section more than tongue constriction
  - For back vowels [u], [o], [a]: more dependent on front cavity
- **Third formant (F3)**: Chiefly dependent on front of tongue constriction for [u], [o], [a]
  - For [i]: back cavity is main determinant
  - For [e]: dependency more equally divided across vocal tract sections
- **Fourth/Fifth formants (F4, F5)**: Marked influence of larynx cavity on [o], [u], [i]

### Double Resonator Theory Approximations (pp. 123-124)
Approximate formulas for resonance frequencies:

$$F_{low} = \frac{c}{2\pi} \left[ V_b \left( \frac{l_1}{A_1} + \frac{l_2}{A_2} \right) \right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
(Eq. 2.3-3)

$$F_{high} = \frac{c}{2\pi} \left[ \left( \frac{A_1}{l_1} + \frac{A_2}{l_2} \right) \frac{1}{V_1} \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

Where:
- c = speed of sound
- V_b = back cavity volume
- V_1 = front cavity volume
- A_1, A_2 = cross-sectional areas of resonator necks
- l_1, l_2 = lengths of resonator necks

Valid provided:
$$\frac{V_1}{V_2} << 1 + l_2 A_1 / l_1 A_2$$
(Eq. 2.3-4)

### Attenuation/Damping Formula (p. 125)

$$\alpha = 0.007(\pi/A)^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot (1/2 + f/4000)$$
(Eq. 2.3-5)

Where:
- alpha = attenuation constant (Nepers/cm)
- A = cross-sectional area
- f = frequency in Hz
- Provides natural range of formant bandwidths
- Equal at 2000 c/s (constant and linear terms)

### Voice Source Spectrum (p. 126)

$$|U_g(f)| = \frac{150}{1 + f^2/100^2} \text{ cm}^3/\text{sec}$$
(Eq. 2.3-6)

- DC flow component: 150 cm^3/sec
- Waveform: double pole at 100 c/s on negative real frequency axis
- Falls -12 dB/octave above cutoff frequency 100 c/s
- Standard source for all voiced sounds in this work

### Sound Pressure Relations (p. 126)

$$P_{lip}/P_l = \frac{0.8(A/\pi)^{\frac{1}{2}} 4\pi l}{A \cdot K_T(\omega)}$$
(Eq. 2.3-7)

- Radiation inductance at lips: L_0 = 0.8(A/pi)^(1/2) * rho/A

### Pressure Distribution Equations (p. 128)

For single tube resonator with volume velocity source U_g(omega):

$$\frac{P(x,\omega)}{U_g(\omega)} = z \frac{\sinh(j\omega/c + a)x}{\cosh(j\omega/c + a)l}$$
(Eq. 2.3-8)

Volume velocity transfer ratio:
$$\frac{U(x,\omega)}{U_g(\omega)} = \frac{\cosh(j\omega/c + a)x}{\cosh(j\omega/c + a)l}$$
(Eq. 2.3-9)

### Nasalization Transform Equations (p. 150)

Combined oral and nasal output:
$$P_M(s) + P_N(s) = U_g(s)H(s)R(s)[k_{zM}(s)H_{zM}(s) + k_{zN}(s)H_{zN}(s)]$$
(Eq. 2.4-1)

Where:
- P_M(s), P_N(s) = Laplace transforms of oral and nasal components
- U_g(s) = source factor
- H(s) = pole factor
- R(s) = radiation characteristics

Zero functions:
$$H_{zM}(s) = \prod_{i=1}^{\infty} [1 + (s + \bar{\sigma}_{Mi})^2/\bar{\omega}_{Mi}^2]$$
(Eq. 2.4-2)

$$H_{zN}(s) = \prod_{j=1}^{\infty} [1 + (s + \bar{\sigma}_{Nj})^2/\bar{\omega}_{Nj}^2]$$
(Eq. 2.4-3)

Zero frequency and bandwidth (high Q approximation):
$$F_{zMi} = \bar{\omega}_{Mi}/2\pi$$
$$B_{zMi} = \bar{\sigma}_{Mi}/\pi$$
(Eq. 2.4-4)

Zeros of mixed oral/nasal output:
$$k_{zM}(s)H_{zM}(s) + k_{zN}(s)H_{zN}(s) = 0$$
(Eq. 2.4-5)

Shunt factors (frequency independent):
$$k_M = L_N/(L_M + L_N)$$
$$k_N = L_M/(L_M + L_N)$$
(Eq. 2.4-6)

First zero frequency and bandwidth:
$$F_{z1} = F_{zM_1} \cdot k_M^{-\frac{1}{2}} (1+a)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
$$B_{z1} = B_{zM_1} \left[ \frac{1 + aB_{zN_1}/B_{zM_1}}{1+a} \right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
(Eq. 2.4-7)

Where: a = k_N * F^2_{zM_1} / F^2_{zN_1} * k_M

### Damping Source Values (pp. 136-138)

- Radiation resistance: 1.6-7.3 rho*c for F1, 0.14-3.8 rho*c for F2, 0.45-4.2 rho*c for F3
- Glottis resistance: approximately 5 rho*c
- Cavity wall vibrations: contribute somewhat to B1 of front vowels (5-15 rho*c time-variable)
- Closed glottis bandwidth: ~50 c/s measured experimentally

### Nasal Tract Dimensions (pp. 140-142)

- Overall nasal pathway length (uvula to nostrils): ~12.5 cm
- Nasal tract area function modeled with unit filter sections of 1 cm length
- Zero impedance frequencies of nasal network: 1000 c/s, 2800 c/s, 4200 c/s
- Coupling area variations studied: 2.6 cm^2, 0.65 cm^2, 0.16 cm^2

### Nasal Consonant Formant Data (pp. 142-147)

For velar nasal [ng] (mouth cavity shunt removed):
- F1 at 300 c/s (pharynx cavity resonance tuned by nasal system)
- Strong antiresonance at 430 c/s

For [m], [m_j], [n], [n_j]:
- Variable formant at 900 c/s (calculated [m]) to 1400 c/s ([n])
- [n]-spectrum: 1700 c/s, [m_j]-spectrum: 2000 c/s for [n_j]
- Second formant typically identical to second formant of nasalized vowel

### Nasalization Effects on Vowels (pp. 148-160)

Smith (1951) pattern for open nasality:
1. No significant F0 change
2. F1 mostly weakened
3. Formant at ~1000 c/s appears
4. F2 often weakened and raised slightly
5. Formant at ~2000 c/s occasionally
6. F3 weakened and lowered
7. F4 intensified
8. Resonances above F4 tend to weaken

Delattre (1954) pattern playback:
1. F1 weakened (primary cue)
2. Nasal formant at ~250 c/s (secondary cue)

House and Stevens (1956) synthesis findings:
1. F1 weakened with increased bandwidth and higher center frequency
2. Overall vowel level reduced
3. Various secondary effects: anti-resonance at 900-1800 c/s, F3 irregularities

## Vocal Tract Models

### Horn-Shaped Model for [i] (p. 133, Fig. 2.3-8)
Eight variations showing damping factors:
1. Normal LEA configuration
2. Normal with larynx cavity
3. Larynx configuration + sinus piriformis (shunting larynx outlet)
4. Radiation resistance reduced to one-half
5. Tongue constriction area reduced by factor of 2 (F3+F4 double peak apparent)
6. Glottis resistance reduced from 5 to 2.5 rho*c
7. Added 0.25 rho*c resistance in series with tongue constriction
8. Added series resistance in middle of pharynx

### Nasal Tract Model (pp. 141-143)

Configuration for [m], [m_j], [n], [n_j]:
- Nasal branch: unit filter sections of 1 cm with variable area
- Coupling at velar-pharyngeal junction
- Termination: radiation and mixing with radiated oral output
- Standard voice source: -12 dB/octave spectrum envelope

LEA analog setup:
- 1 rho*c resistor shunting nasal tract at midpoint
- Terminating link simulates radiation effects

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer

1. **Formant Bandwidth Implementation**:
   - Use Table 2.34-1 values as starting points for vowel bandwidths
   - B1: 40-70 Hz typical, B2: 50-125 Hz, B3: 77-240 Hz
   - Bandwidths have three main contributors: radiation (A), glottis (B), wall losses (C)

2. **Source Spectrum**:
   - Model as 150/(1+f^2/100^2) cm^3/sec
   - -12 dB/octave rolloff above 100 Hz
   - This matches Klatt's typical source specification

3. **Nasalization Parameters**:
   - Primary cue: F1 weakening (amplitude reduction)
   - Secondary cue: Add nasal formant around 250-300 Hz
   - Add anti-resonances (zeros):
     - First zero typically at 800-1000 c/s for [a]
     - Zero shifts up with vowel height
   - Nasal formants fixed at approximately: 250 c/s, 1000 c/s, 2000 c/s, 3000 c/s

4. **Nasal Consonant Formants**:
   - F1 around 250-300 Hz (low, from pharynx/nasal resonance)
   - Strong antiresonance typically 100-200 Hz above F1
   - Higher formants highly variable depending on place of articulation

5. **Coupling Area Effects**:
   - Large coupling (2.6 cm^2): significant F1 shift and broadening
   - Small coupling (0.16 cm^2): subtle effects, slope change above F1
   - Zero approaches first pole as coupling decreases

6. **Pressure Distribution**:
   - F1: linear rise in mouth, constant in pharynx
   - F2/F3: additional minima inside tract
   - Useful for understanding microphone placement effects
