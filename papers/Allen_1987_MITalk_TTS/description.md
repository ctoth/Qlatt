This book documents the complete MITalk text-to-speech system, a production-ready implementation that converts unrestricted text into intelligible speech through a cascade of text analysis, prosody modeling, and Klatt formant synthesis modules. Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt present explicit algorithms for morphological analysis, letter-to-sound conversion, duration and intonation rules, and the full specification of the 39-parameter Klatt synthesizer. The work is foundational for practical TTS implementation, providing detailed phonetic rules, formant targets, transition templates, and evaluation results (6.9% error rate) that directly inform modern concatenative and parametric speech synthesis systems.
