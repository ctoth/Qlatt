# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The problem of modelling fundamental frequency (Fo) in English speech has been approached experimentally by examining computer-generated plots of Fo of problem sentences read by several male speakers. These sentences exhibit a wide range of syntactic, semantic, and phonetic phenomena, which were specifically chosen to enable comparison of Fo contours and to locate specific pattern alterations, which were then related to the linguistic phenomena. In particular, Fo patterns have been associated with the conveyance of a message from speaker to listener. In varying his Fo, a speaker encodes certain aspects of the linguistic message, to facilitate easier perception on the listener's part.

Syntactically, Fo can be used to segment and delimit portions of utterances into phrasal units, to mark sentences as yes/no questions, and to mark the end of an utterance versus a pause in the utterance. Phrasal units start with Fo rises and often end with Fo falls, but the ends of non-final units frequently have small Fo rises, as opposed to sharper falls at the end of an utterance. These effects were related to offset and deletion syntactic transformations, and to distinguishing among ambiguous sentences.

Semantically, Fo can be used to highlight and emphasize those words in each utterance that the speaker deems important to the message. Essentially, the words least predictable from context receive the heaviest Fo marking or 'accent.' Certain 'inherently contrastive' word classes were found to have heavier accent than others, and certain syntactic transformations had 'focus' effects in that they shifted accent.

## Our Interpretation

This thesis presents a comprehensive rule-based framework for generating natural-sounding fundamental frequency contours in English speech synthesis through a two-level architecture that separates linguistic decision-making (semantic/syntactic) from phonetic implementation. The key contribution establishes quantitative F0 rules derived from experimental recordings that model how speakers use pitch to convey grammatical structure, semantic emphasis, and discourse coherence, with specific rules for accent placement, phrase boundaries, and declination effects. This work is foundational for speech synthesis because it proves that F0 generation can be systematized through explicit rules rather than reliance on natural speech samples, enabling TTS systems to generate natural-sounding prosody by controlling which words receive accent based on word class and semantic importance, while maintaining proper phrase boundaries and declination patterns across utterances.
