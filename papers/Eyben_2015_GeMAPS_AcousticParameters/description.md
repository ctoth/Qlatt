GeMAPS (Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set) proposes a standardized set of 62 acoustic parameters for voice analysis and emotion recognition, addressing the proliferation of non-standardized parameter sets across voice research. The paper demonstrates that this minimalistic set achieves competitive performance with large brute-force feature sets (62 vs 6,000+ parameters) across six emotion databases, with eGeMAPS reaching 79.71% arousal recognition while maintaining interpretability. For speech synthesis, GeMAPS parameters directly map to Klatt control mechanisms: spectral slope and H1-H2 ratios inform voice quality, formant bandwidths relate to damping, and temporal features constrain prosodic rhythm and stress patterns.
