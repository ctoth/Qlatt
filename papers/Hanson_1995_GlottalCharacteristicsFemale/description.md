This thesis investigates the acoustic and physiological characteristics of female glottal voice quality, specifically how incomplete vocal fold closure produces breathier voices than males. Hanson developed quantitative acoustic measures (H1*-A3* spectral tilt, H1*-A1 bandwidth, noise ratings) extractable from speech spectra and validated them against physiological data, identifying spectral tilt as the most perceptually important parameter for breathiness perception. These findings provide direct mappings between acoustic measures and Klatt synthesizer parameters (TL, B1, AH), enabling natural female voice synthesis with scientifically grounded parameter choices rather than trial-and-error tuning.
