This paper presents a comprehensive acoustic analysis of how consonants in Dutch are reduced during spontaneous speech compared to formal read speech, examining duration, formant movement, spectral properties, and energy relationships. The study finds that consonants reduce through decreased duration (proportional to vowels), lower center-of-gravity frequency (indicating reduced articulatory effort), diminished coarticulation strength, and relative energy changes that vary by consonant type. These findings are directly applicable to speech synthesis for modeling speaking style variation, enabling synthesizers to reduce both vowel and consonant duration proportionally, modulate spectral effort based on stress level, and adjust formant transitions and energy relationships to create more natural casual or fast-speech output.
