## Key Findings

### Emotion Recognition Results
- Overall correct identification of emotions: **38.1%** with optimal speech rate, **22.7%** with constant speech rate (chance level: 14.3%)
- Mean percentage of correct identification across two sets of conditions:
  - Neutrality: 56.4%
  - Joy: 27.4%
  - Boredom: 47.3%
  - Anger: 16.7%
  - Sadness: 19.2%
  - Fear: 26.3%
  - Indignation: 20.3%

### Speech Rate and Emotion
- **Overall speech rate is the most important parameter** for conveying emotion in speech
- Boredom and sadness are best conveyed with **low overall speech rate**
- Joy, fear, and anger were found to be optimally identified with **overall speech rate higher than neutrality**
- Sadness best conveyed with **lower overall speech rate than neutrality**
- Indignation has **lower overall speech rate than neutrality** and is characterized by **high durational proportion of accented speech segments**

### Temporal Structure Findings
- The effect of varying durational proportion of accented speech segments is **relatively small** compared to overall speech rate effect
- For five emotions (joy, boredom, anger, sadness, fear), a **linear model** can be considered sufficient for accented/unaccented duration
- For **neutrality**, durational proportion should NOT deviate significantly from linear model
- For **indignation**, relative lengths of accented and unaccented speech segments IS relevant to perception

### Intonation Patterns and Emotion
- Almost all pitch curves in emotional speech can be described with the Dutch intonation grammar ('t Hart, Collier and Cohen, 1990)
- No unique correspondence between specific emotions and specific intonation patterns
- One pattern can convey various emotions; one emotion can be conveyed by various patterns
- The **final pattern of pitch movements** predominantly plays a role in conveying intended emotion

### Speaker Compensation Effect
- If one parameter conveys a specific emotion effectively, there is less need to rely on other cues
- Some speakers rely more on **pitch range variation** (e.g., speaker RS)
- Other speakers rely more on **pitch level** to express emotions (e.g., speaker MR)
- This exemplifies mutual compensation between cues for conveying emotion

## Parameters Found

| Name | Symbol | Units | Value/Range | Context |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Mean F0 | mean F0 | Hz | 100-300 | Male voice range shown in figures |
| Standard deviation of F0 | s.t. | semitones | 2-6 | Relative to mean F0 |
| Duration relative to neutrality | - | % | 0-150% | Varies by emotion and condition |
| Correct identification rate | - | % | 22.7-38.1% | Overall; varies by emotion |

## F0/Prosody Patterns

### Optimal Values by Emotion (from Figures 1-4, page 169)
Three speakers (2 male: MR, RS; 1 female: LO) plus perceptually optimal values:

| Emotion | Duration (% of neutral) | Mean F0 | SD (s.t.) | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Neutrality (N) | 100% | ~200 Hz (male) | ~3 s.t. | Reference |
| Boredom (B) | ~150% | lower | ~2 s.t. | Slow, monotone |
| Sadness (S) | ~150% | lower | ~3 s.t. | Slow |
| Joy (J) | shorter | higher | ~5-6 s.t. | Fast, high variation |
| Anger (A) | shorter | higher | ~5 s.t. | Fast, high variation |
| Fear (F) | variable | higher | ~4-5 s.t. | High pitch |
| Indignation (I) | 100% or longer | higher | ~5-6 s.t. | High accented proportion |

### Intonation Patterns and Emotion (Table 1, page 172)

| Emotion | Pattern(s) to be preferred | Pattern(s) to be avoided |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Neutrality | 1&A | 12 and 3C |
| Joy | 1&A and 5&A | A, EA, and 12 |
| Boredom | 3C | 5&A and 12 |
| Anger | 5&A, A and EA | 1&A and 3C |
| Sadness | 3C | 5&A |
| Fear | 12 and 3C | A and EA |
| Indignation | 12 in particular, but also 3C, A and EA | 1&A |

### Intonation Pattern Clusters (page 175)
- Cluster 1: '1&A 1&A', '1B 1&A', '1D 1&A', '12 1&A' - corresponds to /1A/ basic pattern
- Cluster 2: '1&A 3C', '1B 3C', '1D 3C' - corresponds to /3C/ basic pattern
- Cluster 3: '1A' and '1EA' patterns - formed separate clusters
- Clusters '1&A 12' and '1 5&A' each formed separate clusters

### Duration Rules
- At decreased speech rates: accented speech segments are relatively **less lengthened** than unaccented ones
- At increased speech rates: results are less consistent
- For Sentence 1 (vliegtuig): lengthening of accented syllables increases with increasing overall speech rate
- Turning point exists where durational proportion of accented segments is highest, then decreases with increasing overall speech rate

## Voice Quality Parameters
- Voice quality and intensity were NOT included in this study
- The thesis was restricted to **pitch and temporal variations** in intonation and speech rate
- Future research suggested for: voice quality, intensity

## Formant Data
- No formant data in this chunk (thesis focused on prosody, not spectral characteristics)

## Klatt Synthesizer Details
- Not explicitly mentioned in this chunk
- Speech was re-synthesized using rule-based synthesis
- IPO model of intonation was used for F0 curve generation

## Figures of Interest
- **Figures 1-4 (page 169):** Duration relative to neutrality (%) vs. standard deviation (s.t.) vs. mean F0 (Hz) for male speaker MR, male speaker RS, female speaker LO, and perceptually optimal values. Shows how different speakers use different parameter combinations to express emotions (B=boredom, S=sadness, N=neutrality, J=joy, F=fear, A=anger, I=indignation).

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The largest contribution is clearly the one of overall speech rate. The difference in the results obtained in the presence or absence of utterance level variations, confirm the major importance of overall speech rate for conveying emotion in speech." (page 161)

> "For boredom, for instance, the information conveyed by the overall speech rate overwhelms other effects." (page 161)

> "It is, therefore, concluded that the differences in duration of the accented segments indeed induce the differential effect for neutrality and indignation." (page 158)

> "Speakers appear to adhere to a reasonably limited set of 'acoustic configurations' in the expression of specific emotions." (page 168)

> "If one parameter conveys a specific emotion, other speech parameters can be less distinctive for that emotion." (page 168)

> "Although this pattern is certainly not the best possible choice for expressing each emotion studied here, it leads to acceptable results concerning identification of the emotions studied, when used in combination with appropriate variations in pitch level and pitch range." (page 172, regarding 1&A pattern)

> "For the five emotions, joy, boredom, anger, sadness, and fear, the linear model can be considered sufficient, while, for neutrality, any deviation from this linear model must be avoided, and, for indignation, it is relevant to model the relative lengths of accented and non-accented speech segments." (page 173)

## Implementation Notes

### Rules for Synthesizing Emotional Speech

1. **Overall Speech Rate**
   - Joy, fear, anger: increase overall speech rate (relative to neutrality)
   - Boredom, sadness: decrease overall speech rate
   - Indignation: decrease or maintain overall speech rate

2. **Pitch Level and Range**
   - Joy, anger, fear, indignation: higher pitch level, larger pitch range
   - Boredom: lower pitch level, narrow pitch range
   - Sadness: lower pitch level, moderate pitch range

3. **Durational Proportion of Accented Segments**
   - Indignation: lengthen accented syllables relatively more than unaccented
   - Neutrality: maintain linear relationship between accented/unaccented
   - Other emotions: linear model is sufficient

4. **Intonation Pattern Selection**
   - Use Table 1 (page 172) to select preferred/avoided patterns per emotion
   - 1&A pattern is versatile but not optimal for all emotions
   - Final pattern of pitch movements is particularly important

5. **For TTS Implementation**
   - When overall speech rate is varied, durational proportion effects become less perceptible
   - At constant speech rate, durational proportion manipulation matters more
   - Mutual compensation: if F0 cues are strong, temporal cues can be weaker (and vice versa)
