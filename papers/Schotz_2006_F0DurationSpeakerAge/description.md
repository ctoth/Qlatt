This paper investigates how fundamental frequency and segment duration vary across speaker ages (6-91 years) using a data-driven formant synthesis system (GLOVE) with 23 acoustic parameters extracted from natural Swedish speech. Key findings show that F0 and duration are the most robust perceptual cues for age, with children and elderly speakers producing longer overall segment durations than middle-aged speakers, while creaky voice in young and old speakers can be simulated by halving F0 and activating diplophonia parameters. The work is significant for speech synthesis because it demonstrates that age-appropriate prosody—particularly F0 contours and timing patterns—is essential for naturalness, and provides a systematic analysis-by-synthesis methodology and parameter mapping (including LF voice source model parameters) applicable to Klatt-style synthesizers implementing speaker age variation.
