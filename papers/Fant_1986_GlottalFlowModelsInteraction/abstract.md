# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

The present article summarizes recent work at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm on glottal flow models and source-filter interaction. A four-parameter model of the glottal flow derivative (Fant, Liljencrants & Lin, 1985) has been introduced. It incorporates a return phase after the instant of maximum closure discontinuity, the effective duration of which is inversely related to a spectrum fall-off parameter. The interaction of supraglottal pressure build-up and glottal flow profile accounts for a dependency of voice source characteristics on the vocal-tract filter function (Fant, Lin & Gobl, 1985). The F1 component of supraglottal pressure conditions a substantial part of the interaction. It is demonstrated that a phonation with F1 close to F0 minimizes air consumption, as suggested by Rothenberg (1985). This is also to a less degree found when F1 comes close to 2F0. Other interaction phenomena discussed are the occasional occurrence of a double peak in the glottal flow derivative and perturbations in the wave shape and amplitude of successive glottal flow pulses. At a high pitch, it is the supraglottal pressure build-up from previous periods that dominates the interaction. Glottal friction does not contribute much to the flow waveform and its excitational power.

## Our Interpretation

This paper presents the LF model, a four-parameter mathematical description of how the glottis opens and closes during voicing, with particular attention to what happens after the vocal folds snap shut (the "return phase"). The key insight is that the voice source isn't independent of the vocal tract - pressure waves bouncing back from the vocal tract (especially at F1) actually change the shape of the glottal flow pulse, causing effects like double peaks and pulse-to-pulse variations. For speech synthesis, this means the LF model parameters (especially $t_a$) directly control spectral tilt and breathiness, and that real speech has inherent variations that simple parametric models don't capture.
