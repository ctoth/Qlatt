# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Data on vowel formants have been derived primarily from static measures representing an assumed steady state. This review summarizes data on formant frequencies and bandwidths for American English and also addresses (a) sources of variability (focusing on speech sample and time sampling point), and (b) methods of data reduction such as vowel area and dispersion.

## Our Interpretation

This comprehensive review examines how vowel formant frequencies and bandwidths are measured and reported across the lifespan, identifying significant sources of measurement variability and different approaches to analyzing vowel acoustic space. The paper provides essential guidance for speech scientists and clinicians on standardizing measurement procedures, interpreting formant data across different speaker groups, and understanding the limitations and strengths of various acoustic analysis methods for vowel characterization.
