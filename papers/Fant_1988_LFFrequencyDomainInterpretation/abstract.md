# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

Glottal flow parameters are generally defined as time-domain entities that specify the shape of glottal pulses or their derivatives. The present study is concerned with the relations of glottal parameters to frequency-domain properties in order to bring out perceptually important aspects. The analysis also aims at techniques to extract frequency- as well as time-domain parameters from frequency-domain representations. This involves frequency-domain inverse filtering, analytical transformations, and analysis-by-synthesis procedures. Frequency-domain processing is recommended as a complement to or a substitute to conventional time-domain analysis. An advantage is the less severe demands on low-frequency recording fidelity. Moreover, already available narrow-band spectral sections may be processed in order to derive major voice source parameters. The frequency-domain matching ensures optimal conditions for Hi-Fi resynthesis. The theoretical analysis also sheds light on time-domain processing techniques suitable to support frequency-domain processing, e.g., selective inverse filtering. The frequency-domain analysis includes studies of covarying formant bandwidths and subglottal coupling effects which become especially apparent in breathy voicing.

## Our Interpretation

This paper bridges the gap between LF model time-domain parameters (like Tp, Te, Ta) and what they actually do to the voice spectrum. The key insight is that the return phase parameter Ta acts as a first-order low-pass filter with cutoff Fa = 1/(2πTa), making it the primary control for spectral tilt and voice quality. The paper provides complete equations for extracting LF parameters from spectral analysis rather than requiring pristine time-domain recordings, and explains quantitatively why male and female voices sound different despite having similar underlying Uo/Ee ratios.
