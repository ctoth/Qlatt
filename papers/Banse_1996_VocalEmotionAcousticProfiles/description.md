This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of acoustic profiles for 14 distinct emotions, measuring 29 acoustic parameters (fundamental frequency, energy, spectral distribution, speech rate, articulation duration) across 224 actor portrayals to establish quantitative acoustic correlates of emotional speech. Key findings show that high-arousal emotions like hot anger and panic fear exhibit elevated mean F0, increased energy, and enhanced high-frequency content, while low-arousal emotions like sadness and boredom show reduced F0, lower intensity, and flattened spectra, with recognition accuracy ranging from 78% for hot anger to 15% for disgust. For speech synthesis, these emotion-specific acoustic profiles provide concrete targets for modulating F0 contours, spectral tilt, energy distribution, and speech rate to convey distinct emotional expressions in synthetic speech.
