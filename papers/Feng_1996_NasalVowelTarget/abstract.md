# Abstract

## Original Text (Verbatim)

In order to characterize acoustic properties of nasal and nasalized vowels, these sounds will be considered as a dynamic trend from an oral configuration toward an [η]-like configuration. The latter can be viewed as a target for vowel nasalization. This target corresponds to the pharyngonasal tract and it can be modeled, with some simplifications, by a single tract without any parallel paths. Thus the first two resonance frequencies (at about 300 and 1000 Hz) characterize this target well. A series of measurements has been carried out in order to describe the acoustic characteristics of the target. Measured transfer functions confirm the resonator nature of the low-frequency peak. The introduction of such a target allows the conception of the nasal vowels as a trend beginning with a simple configuration, which is terminated in the same manner, so allowing the complex nasal phenomena to be bounded. A complete study of pole-zero evolutions for the nasalization of the 11 French vowels is presented. It allows the proposition of a common strategy for the nasalization of all vowels, so a true nasal vowel can be placed in this nasalization frame. The measured transfer functions for several French nasal vowels are also given.

## Our Interpretation

This paper proposes the pharyngonasal tract as an acoustic target for nasal vowel production, characterized by two key resonance peaks around 300 Hz and 1000 Hz. The authors present comprehensive measurements confirming that nasal vowels can be understood as dynamic transitions from oral configurations toward this nasal target, and they establish a unified nasalization framework that applies to all 11 French vowels through systematic pole-zero evolution analysis. This work is essential for speech synthesis because it provides a principled acoustic basis for generating natural-sounding nasal vowels by modeling the progressive velic lowering gesture and the resulting spectral transformations.
