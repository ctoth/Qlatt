This paper investigates hybrid text-to-speech synthesis by combining formant-generated obstruents and reduced vowels with natural concatenative samples, demonstrating that approximately 37% of speech segments can be synthesized without degrading voice quality. Hertz finds that voiceless stops, fricatives, and reduced vowels synthesize well and can even exceed natural quality in some cases, while stressed vowels and long syllabic nuclei remain the primary quality bottleneck requiring natural samples. These findings have direct implications for formant synthesizers like Qlatt, suggesting that quality improvements should focus on stressed syllable nuclei rather than consonants, and that spectral tilt and aspiration parameters significantly affect reduced vowel naturalness.
