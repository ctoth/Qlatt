Cantor Digitalis is a parametric formant synthesizer for real-time expressive singing control using chironomic (hand gesture) input, featuring a spectral voice source model with glottal formant and spectral tilt filters combined with parallel vocal tract formants and anti-resonance. The system contributes comprehensive source-filter dependency rules that link fundamental frequency, vocal effort, and formant frequencies, including mechanisms for formant tuning to f0 harmonics, effort-dependent spectral tilt, and heartbeat/slow perturbations for naturalness. This work is valuable for speech synthesis because it demonstrates how to model singing voice quality variations through parametric control and provides practical equations for mapping high-level performance gestures to low-level synthesis parameters, offering an alternative to cascade-based formant synthesis with novel handling of harmonic-formant interactions.
