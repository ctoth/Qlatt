## Key Findings

### Vowel Perception and Two-Formant Matching
- When spacing between F2 and F3 is less than ~3.0 bark, listeners perceive them as a single broad spectral prominence (p. 240-241)
- Critical distance between spectral prominences: ~3.5 bark for qualitative change in auditory response
- F1-F0 distance also influences vowel perception and classification

### Phonological Features (Chapter 5)
- Two classes of features: **articulator-free** and **articulator-bound** (Halle and Stevens, 1991a)
- Articulator-free features: defined without reference to any particular articulator
- Articulator-bound features: specify which articulators are active and their configuration
- Features are binary (+/-) and have both articulatory and acoustic correlates

### Articulator-Free Features (Table 5.1)
| Feature | Vowels | Glides | Consonants | n,l | t,b | theta,delta |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Vocalic | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Consonantal | - | - | + | + | + | + |
| Continuant | | | - | + | - | + |
| Sonorant | | | + | - | - | - |
| Strident | | | | | + | - |

### Articulator-Bound Features (Table 5.2)
**Oral region:** Round, Anterior, Distributed, Lateral, High, Low, Back
**Pharyngeal-laryngeal region:** Nasal, Advanced tongue root, Constricted tongue root, Spread glottis, Constricted glottis
**Surface stiffness:** Stiff vocal folds, Slack vocal folds

### Acoustic Landmarks
- **Vocalic landmarks**: Syllabic peaks (maxima in F1 amplitude/frequency)
- **Consonantal landmarks**: Abrupt acoustic discontinuities signaling [+consonantal] segments
- **Glide landmarks**: Minimum in low-frequency amplitude that is evidence for [-vocalic, -consonantal]

### Six Articulators Producing Sounds
1. Lips
2. Tongue blade
3. Tongue body
4. Soft palate
5. Pharynx
6. Glottis
7. Vocal folds (stiffening/slackening)

### Formant Bandwidths (Chapter 6)
- Formant bandwidths determined by acoustic losses: vocal tract walls, viscosity, heat conduction, radiation
- Wall losses dominate at low frequencies; radiation losses dominate at high frequencies
- Average F1 bandwidth for modal voicing: ~80 Hz for high vowels
- Bandwidth greater during open phase of glottal vibration, less during closed phase

### Constriction Size Effects
- Constriction size 0.2 to 0.4 cm^2: vowels produced with narrowest point without turbulence noise
- Below ~0.2 cm^2: pressure drop causes turbulence noise generation

### High Vowels (/i/, /u/)
- Characterized by:
  - Low F1 (close to F0)
  - Narrow spectral dip below first spectral peak
  - High tongue body position
- F1 stability achieved by tongue position within 1-2 mm accuracy for 250-350 Hz range
- Distinguishing characteristic: F1 within 100-200 Hz of F0 (spacing <3 bark)

### Vowel Classification Acoustic Cues
- **High vowels**: F0-F1 spacing < 3 bark
- **Non-high vowels**: F0-F1 spacing > 3 bark with significant amplitude fall below F1 peak
- **Low vowels**: Maximally high F1, constriction/narrowing in pharyngeal region
- **Non-low vowels**: Intermediate F1

### Low Vowels (/a/, /ae/)
- Narrowing in posterior (pharyngeal) region, widening in anterior (oral) region
- Tongue body low in mouth cavity
- High F1 achieved through pharyngeal constriction
- Minimum cross-sectional area: ~0.2-0.4 cm^2 critical value
- Lateral tongue edges contact lower teeth for stability

## Equations Found

### First Formant Frequency (Helmholtz Resonator Approximation)
$$F1' = \frac{c}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{A_c}{V\ell_c}}$$
where:
- $c$ = velocity of sound
- $V$ = volume behind constriction
- $A_c$ = cross-sectional area of constriction
- $\ell_c$ = length of constriction

### First Formant with Wall Mass Correction
$$F1 = \sqrt{(F1')^2 + F_c^2}$$
where:
- $F_c$ = lowest natural frequency of vocal tract with complete closure
- $F_c$ ranges from 150-200 Hz for adults (Fant, 1972)

### Peak-to-Valley Ratio for Formant Bandwidth
When formants are equally spaced, the peak-to-valley ratio is given by:
$$2S/\pi B$$
where:
- $S$ = spacing between formants (Hz)
- $B$ = bandwidth

## Formant Data

### High Vowels /i/ and /u/ (Figure 6.4)
- F1 close to F0 (fundamental frequency)
- Narrow spacing between F0 and F1 (within ~3 bark)
- For /i/: F2 high (~2200-2500 Hz), F3 close to F2
- For /u/: F2 low (~700-900 Hz), F1 and F2 close together

### F1-F0 Bark Difference (Figure 6.4, from spectra)
| Vowel | Speaker | F1-F0 (bark) |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| /i/ | Female | ~0.9 |
| /i/ | Male | ~1.4 |
| /u/ | Female | ~1.6 |
| /u/ | Male | ~1.7 |
| /a/ | Female | ~5.2 |
| /a/ | Male | ~5.2 |

### F0 Adjustment for High Vowels
- Speakers produce high vowels with F0 that is 10-20 Hz higher than for non-high vowels (Peterson & Barney, 1952)
- This adjustment reduces F1-F0 difference and enhances high vowel identification

### Two-Tube Model Formant Frequencies (Figure 6.9)
For total length l1 + l2 = 16 cm, A2 = 3 cm^2:
- When A1 = 0.5 cm^2: F2 minimum ~800 Hz at l1 = 8 cm
- When A1 = 0: F2 minimum lower
- F1 remains low (200-300 Hz) across wide range of back cavity lengths

### Front Vowel Configurations (Figure 6.11)
For configuration l_c = 5 cm, A1 = 3.0 cm^2, Ac = 0.3 cm^2, A2 = 1.0 cm^2:
- F1: ~200-300 Hz (low, stable)
- F2: broad maximum in middle of range (~1500-2000 Hz)
- F3, F4: traverse maxima and minima

### Low Vowel Model (Figure 6.14)
Configuration: A1 = A2 = 3.0 cm^2, Ac = 0.3 cm^3, Am = 0.3 cm^2
- F1 remains in vicinity of 300 Hz over wide range of constriction positions
- F2 minimum when constriction ~5 cm from glottal end
- Back vowel /u/: constriction 7-8 cm from glottis

## Rules/Algorithms

### Landmark Detection for Segmentation
1. **Vocalic landmarks**: Identify maxima in F1 amplitude prominence (syllable nuclei)
2. **Consonantal landmarks**: Identify rapid F1 movements (downward at closure, upward at release)
3. **Glide landmarks**: Identify minima in low-frequency amplitude

### Vowel Height Classification
1. If F1-F0 spacing < 3 bark: classify as [+high]
2. If significant amplitude drop below F1: classify as [-high]
3. For non-high: if F1 maximally high with pharyngeal narrowing: classify as [+low]

### Feature Sequencing Constraints
1. Glide landmarks must immediately precede vocalic landmarks
2. [+sonorant] consonants must occur immediately adjacent to [+vocalic] segments or glides
3. Permitted: sequences like "snail" or "mute" ([mjut])
4. Not permitted within syllable: sequences like [nsap]

### Two-Tube Model for Vowel Synthesis
1. Estimate back cavity length (l1) and front cavity length (l2) such that l1 + l2 = total vocal tract length
2. Set cross-sectional areas A1 (back) and A2 (front)
3. For low vowels: narrow back tube at glottis end, wide front tube at mouth
4. For high vowels: constriction in oral cavity region
5. Include tapered transition between tubes for better approximation

### Bandwidth Estimation from Acoustic Losses
Sum contributions from:
1. Wall losses (dominant at low frequencies)
2. Viscosity losses
3. Heat conduction
4. Radiation losses (dominant at high frequencies, especially F3+)
5. Glottal losses (variable with voicing mode)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

> "The implication of these matching experiments is that some aspect of the response of the auditory system undergoes a qualitative change when the spacing between two spectral prominences becomes less than a critical value of about 3.5 bark." (p. 241)

> "A segment with the feature [+vocalic] forms the nucleus of a syllable. Such a segment is generally produced with a maximum in the vocal tract opening in the oral cavity." (p. 245)

> "The constriction size for which this condition occurs is generally in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 cm^2. In our discussions in this chapter, we are concerned primarily with sounds produced when the narrowest point in the vocal tract is not sufficiently constricted to cause this effect on the sound output when the acoustic source is the volume velocity resulting from modal (or pressed) vocal fold vibration." (p. 255-256)

> "A distinguishing characteristic of high vowels is that the first-formant frequency is generally within 100 to 200 Hz of the fundamental frequency." (p. 264)

> "High vowels, then, can be described acoustically as having spectra with only a narrow and shallow low-frequency dip in the spectrum below the first spectral peak." (p. 264)

> "For a low vowel with a backed tongue body, as in the left panel of figure 6.6, the first formant is often associated primarily with the back cavity, consisting for the most part of the pharynx, while the closely spaced third and fourth formants are associated respectively with the lowest natural frequency of the anterior constricted region and the second natural frequency of the back cavity." (p. 277)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer Implementation

1. **F1 Bandwidth Selection**
   - Use ~80 Hz for high vowels with modal voicing
   - Increase bandwidth for open vowels (larger mouth opening increases radiation losses)
   - Account for glottal configuration: bandwidth varies within glottal cycle

2. **High Vowel Synthesis**
   - Keep F1 low (250-350 Hz typical)
   - Ensure F1-F0 spacing less than ~3 bark (300-400 Hz)
   - For /i/: F2 high (~2200-2500 Hz), close to F3
   - For /u/: F2 low (~700-1000 Hz), close to F1

3. **Low Vowel Synthesis**
   - F1 high (600-800 Hz typical)
   - F2 variable depending on front/back:
     - /ae/ (front): F2 ~1700-2000 Hz
     - /a/ (back): F2 ~1000-1300 Hz
   - F3 bandwidth may be wider (~200 Hz) due to radiation losses

4. **Formant Bandwidth Approximations**
   - B1: ~50-80 Hz for F1 < 500 Hz, increasing for higher F1
   - B2, B3: ~50-70 Hz baseline, increasing with frequency
   - Above 2000 Hz: bandwidths increase more rapidly due to radiation

5. **Two-Tube Model Insights for Parameter Setting**
   - Front vowels: back cavity ~4 cm, front cavity ~12 cm
   - Back vowels: back cavity ~8-10 cm, front cavity ~6-8 cm
   - Second formant shows maximum/minimum behavior depending on cavity ratio
   - F2 minimum value ~800 Hz occurs when back and front cavities equal length

6. **Spectral Peak Clustering**
   - When F2-F3 or F3-F4 are within ~3 bark, they form perceptual cluster
   - For high front /i/: F2, F3, F4 often clustered
   - For high back /u/: F1, F2 relatively close

7. **Acoustic Landmarks for Segmentation**
   - Track F1 amplitude for vocalic landmarks (maxima = vowel nuclei)
   - Track low-frequency amplitude for glide detection (minima)
   - Track rapid F1 transitions for consonant landmarks

8. **Critical Parameters for Vowel Contrasts**
   - High/non-high: F1 frequency and F1-F0 spacing
   - Front/back: F2 frequency (and F2-F1 spacing)
   - Round/unround: F2 lowering, formant clustering
