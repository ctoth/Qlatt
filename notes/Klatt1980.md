### Nasal pole/zero guidance (FNP/FNZ)
From p. 981 (cropped in `papers/klatt1980-page-10-crop-mid.png`):

- “Nasal murmurs and vowel nasalization are approximated by the insertion of an
  additional resonator RNP and anti-resonator RNZ into the cascade vocal tract model.”
- “The nasal pole frequency FNP can be set to a fixed value of about 270 Hz for all time.”
- “The nasal zero frequency FNZ should also be set to a value of about 270 Hz
  during non-nasalized sounds, but the frequency of the nasal zero must be increased
  during the production of nasals and nasalization.”
- “The RNP–RNZ pair is effectively removed from the cascade circuit during the synthesis
  of non-nasalized speech sounds if FNP = FNZ.”

### Alternating sign in parallel formants
From p. 982 (cropped in `papers/klatt1980-page-11-crop-alt.png`):

- Early parallel synthesizers either summed formant outputs directly or used alternating sign.
- Both approaches can model some vowels poorly; alternating sign is less perceptually
  degrading because spectral notches are less perceptible than “energy fill” between
  formants (see Fig. 13 in the paper).

### Parallel branch amplitude constraints
From p. 982 (cropped in `papers/klatt1980-page-11-crop-b.png`):

- “The amplitudes of the formant peaks generated by the parallel vocal tract model
  have been constrained such that, if A1 to A5 are all set to 60 dB, the transfer function
  will approximate that found in the cascade model.”
- This is achieved by: (1) adjusting higher-frequency formant gain to account for lower
  formants, (2) rules to increase formant amplitudes when two formants are in proximity,
  and (3) first-difference filtering to remove low-frequency energy from higher formants.

## Notes / pending confirmation

- The control parameter list in Appendix B includes: AV, AF, AH, AVS, F0, F1–F6, B1–B6,
  AN, A1–A6, AB, FNZ, FNP, BNZ, BNP, etc. (see `papers/klatt1980-page-20-crop-b.png`).
- I did not capture the full parameter table with “typical values” in this pass. If needed,
  extract the specific table page at higher resolution.
