## Key Findings

### Stop Consonant Acoustics (Chapter 7 continuation)
- Vocal fold vibration onset occurs ~10 ms following stop release
- Formant transitions following release are mirror images of trajectories at closure
- Frication and transient spectra exceed vowel spectrum in F5 range by 15-20 dB
- High-frequency domination is due to resonance of short cavity in front of alveolar constriction
- For /d/ burst: amplitude is ~11 dB greater than vowel spectrum
- For /b/ burst: amplitude is ~17 dB lower than /d/ burst
- Predicted high-frequency burst amplitudes are a few dB greater for neutral formant vowels

### Velar Stop Consonants (/g/, /k/)
- Classified as [+high] in feature system
- Constriction length is 5-6 cm from lips (greater than labial/alveolar)
- Rate of cross-sectional area change at release: ~25 cm^2/s
- F2 and F3 converge near closure due to back cavity resonance proximity
- At release, F1 is low (~200 Hz), F2 and F3 are close together
- For front vowel context, F3 may increase and become close to F4
- Transient amplitude for velar release is ~12 dB below labial consonant
- Release-to-voicing time: ~22 ms (slightly longer than labial release ~10 ms)
- Burst spectrum shows prominence at ~1500 Hz (second-formant range) with lesser prominence at 3x that frequency
- F2 spectral prominence at vowel onset is within 1-2 dB of burst prominence
- F2 and F3 come closer together as closure is approached, and separate following voicing onset

### Noise Sources for Velars
- Sound pressure source proportional to U^3 * A_c^(-2.5) (equation 2.21)
- At glottal constriction: turbulence noise is generated
- Dipole noise dominates at high frequencies (>3 kHz)
- Monopole noise dominates at low frequencies (<1.5 kHz)
- Both sources contribute at intermediate frequencies
- For alveolar: dipole noise dominates monopole
- For velar: monopole makes significant contribution to frication noise at low frequencies

### Summary: Voiceless Unaspirated Stop Consonants (Section 7.5)
At stop consonant release, the following sequence occurs:
1. Transient (burst of frication noise due to turbulence near constriction)
2. Aspiration noise (turbulence in vicinity of glottis)
3. Formant transitions into the vowel

Sound source modeling:
- Calculate pressures/airflows through time-varying constrictions
- Estimate source characteristics from pressures and flows
- Filter sources through vocal tract transfer function

### Fricative Consonants (Chapter 8)
- Produced by narrow constriction generating turbulence noise
- Glottal opening usually > cross-sectional area of supraglottal constriction
- Two key attributes distinguishing fricatives from unaspirated stops:
  1. Narrow constriction rather than complete closure
  2. Glottal adjustment to maximize turbulence noise amplitude

### Aerodynamic Characteristics (Section 8.1.1)
- Glottal area A_g adjusted to be ~2x the supraglottal constriction area A_c
- Pressure drop across constriction: Delta P_c = P_s / (1 + (A_c/A_g)^2)
- If A_g = 2*A_c, then Delta P_c is ~80% of subglottal pressure P_s
- Glottal width increases by ~0.07 cm for 8 cm H2O pressure, 1 cm glottal length
- Maximum glottal area during fricative: 0.18 + 0.14 = 0.32 cm^2
- Cross-sectional area for /s/ constriction: ~0.1 cm^2

### Low-Frequency Characteristics (Section 8.1.2)
- Increased glottal opening causes breathiness in glottal source
- Results in decreased F1 amplitude relative to first harmonic
- F1 frequency during constricted interval: ~400 Hz (natural frequency of closed configuration)
- F1 bandwidth near boundary can become very large (approaching critical damping)
- Normal F1 bandwidth values: 20-30 ms preceding and following boundaries
- F1 values at voicing offset/onset: >400 Hz
- Transition duration: 30-40 ms

### Turbulence Noise Source (Section 8.1.3)
- Noise amplitude proportional to U^3 * A_c^(-2.5) (constriction) and U^3 * A_g^(-2.5) (glottis)
- Optimal constriction area for maximum noise: ~1/sqrt(5) or ~45% of glottal area
- Noise amplitude at constriction is about 25-75% of glottal opening area
- Close to boundaries, glottal noise source amplitude becomes comparable to constriction noise
- Reference spectrum level: 20 log U^3 * A^(-2.5) is ~212 dB (figure 2.33)

### Labial Fricatives /f/ (Section 8.1.4)
- Lower lip placed close to upper incisors
- Constriction ~0.9 cm from front of cavity
- Front-cavity resonance: ~10 kHz (lowest resonant frequency)
- Spectrum characteristics:
  - F_d (dipole): dominant at low frequencies
  - Combined F (dipole + monopole) spectrum at higher frequencies
  - Frication noise is ~10 dB below F2 peak amplitude in vowel
  - 20-25 dB weaker than vowel in F3-F4 regions
- Formant transitions follow trends similar to labial stop consonants
- F2 boundary frequency ~200 Hz lower than for adjacent neutral vowel when A_c = 0.25 cm^2

### Alveolar Fricatives /s/ (Section 8.1.5)
- Constriction against alveolar ridge, airstream impinges on lower incisors
- Source is dipole noise on incisors surface
- Scaling: 20 log U^3 * A^(-2.5) relative to 212 dB reference (figure 2.33)
- Correction of -5 dB for obstacle angle
- Front cavity effective length: 2.0 cm (male), somewhat less for female
- Natural frequency of 2 cm front cavity: 4500 Hz
- Transfer function pole at 4500 Hz (front cavity), zeros at 0 Hz and ~18 kHz
- Frication spectrum is 2 dB higher than burst spectrum for alveolar stop
- Higher-frequency component at boundary excites F3 and subglottal resonance (~1800 Hz)

## Rules/Algorithms

### Stop Consonant Release Sequence
1. At release, transient burst generated (combination of initial transient + turbulence)
2. ~10 ms after release: onset of vocal fold vibration
3. Formant transitions: mirror images of closure trajectories
4. High-frequency spectrum amplitude: burst + aspiration dominate over vowel spectrum

### Fricative Production Rules
1. Glottal area adjusted to ~2x supraglottal constriction area
2. Voicing offset: ~105 ms before supraglottal release; onset: ~0 ms after
3. Pressure peak occurs when areas of glottal and supraglottal constrictions are approximately equal
4. Vocal fold vibration ceases when transglottal pressure drops below ~3 cm H2O
5. Maximum aspiration source amplitude occurs 40 ms after constriction release (vs ~0 ms for figure 8.9)

### Source Amplitude Calculation for Fricatives
1. Start with reference spectrum (figure 2.33/2.35)
2. Scale by 20 log U^3 A^(-2.5)
3. Apply radiation characteristic
4. Add coupling factor for front cavity (if applicable)
5. Combine dipole and monopole contributions

### Formant Frequency Estimation at Fricative Boundary
1. Model vocal tract as uniform tube with constriction
2. Use equivalent circuit (figure 8.5): R_g, M_g (glottis), M_c, R_c (constriction), Z_tr (trachea)
3. F1 at boundary approaches 400 Hz (closed configuration)
4. F1 bandwidth increases significantly near boundary (can approach critical damping)

## Quotes Worth Preserving

"At the stop-consonant release the following sequence of events occur: a transient, a burst of frication noise due to turbulence in the airflow near the constriction, aspiration noise due to turbulence in the vicinity of the glottis, and transitions of the formants into the vowel." (p. 375)

"The generation of the sound sources for these events is modeled by calculating pressures across the time-varying constrictions and airflows through the constrictions, and by estimating the source characteristics from these pressures and flows." (p. 375-376)

"Fricative consonants are produced by forming a narrow constriction at some point along the length of the vocal tract and generating turbulence noise in the vicinity of this supraglottal constriction." (p. 378)

"The narrowing of the supraglottal constriction in the oral cavity causes a lowering of the frequency and bandwidth of the first formant at the boundaries between the consonant and the vowel." (p. 384)

"The noise amplitude at the constriction shows little variation throughout most of the constricted interval, in spite of changes in the constriction area and in the airflow. This relative stability of the noise amplitude with changes in constriction size has been discussed in section 2.2.4." (p. 388)

"The frication noise spectrum for the labiodental fricative is similar to the aspiration noise spectrum in figure 7.18." (p. 392)

## Implementation Notes

### For Klatt Synthesizer - Stop Consonants
1. **Burst timing**: Onset of vocal fold vibration ~10 ms after release for voiceless unaspirated stops
2. **Spectral balance**: Frication/transient spectra should exceed vowel spectrum in F5 range by 15-20 dB
3. **Velar vs labial/alveolar bursts**: Velar transient amplitude ~12 dB below labial
4. **F2-F3 convergence**: For velars, F2 and F3 approach each other near closure (characteristic "velar pinch")
5. **Release-to-voicing time**: Velars ~22 ms, labials/alveolars ~10 ms

### For Klatt Synthesizer - Fricatives
1. **F1 during fricative**: Should be ~400 Hz (natural frequency of partially closed configuration)
2. **F1 bandwidth**: Increases significantly at boundaries; model with varying BW parameter
3. **Transition duration**: 30-40 ms for F1 movement into/out of fricative
4. **Noise source**: Use 20 log U^3 A^(-2.5) scaling; reference at 212 dB
5. **Aspiration noise timing**: Peaks ~40 ms after release for fricatives with glottal abduction; ~0 ms for maintained abduction

### Frication Amplitude Rules
1. **Labial /f/**: Frication ~10 dB below F2 peak, 20-25 dB below F3-F4 vowel peaks
2. **Alveolar /s/**: Frication 2 dB > alveolar stop burst; dominant above 3 kHz
3. **At boundaries**: Aspiration noise can dominate frication in F3-F4 regions

### Source Spectral Differences
| Source Type | Dominant Range | Spectrum Shape |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Dipole (F_d) | >3 kHz | Rising with frequency |
| Monopole | <1.5 kHz | Flat/falling |
| Combined F | Intermediate | Peaks at formant frequencies |
| Aspiration A | Near boundaries | Similar to neutral vowel excitation |

### Key Timing Parameters for TTS
- Voicing offset before VC boundary: ~105 ms (for fricatives)
- Voicing onset after CV boundary: ~0 ms
- F1 transition duration: 30-40 ms
- Peak aspiration amplitude: 40 ms after release (if glottis actively abducted)
